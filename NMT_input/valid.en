to the land Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine), before me. 
I carried off 900 people, 150 oxen, 1,000 sheep, horses, mules, (and) asses. 
In my second palû, I marched to the lands Namri (and) Bīt-Singibūti (Bīt-Sangibūti)... the land Bīt-Barrūa, ... my ... granted to me. I cut (them) down with the sword (lit. “weapon”) (and) carried off their booty... I placed a eunuch of mine (as provincial governor) over the land Parsua (i 10') (and another) eunuch of mine (as provincial governor) over the land Bīt-Ḫamban, (and) I annexed those lands to Assyria.
I ordered (my troops) to march (lit. “their march”) to the land Ḫalziatbar, a rebellious land, ... I took the road to ... the land Urarṭu, opposite ... (25) I ferociously (and) furiously entered the pass(es) of Mount Izza...

I annexed to Assyria the land Ulluba in its entirety, the cities of Bitirru, Parīsu, Tašuḫa, Manṭun, Sardaurriana, Diulla-ana-Nal, Sikibsa, Aššurdāya, Babutta, Lusia, (and) Tapsia, fortresses of the land Urarṭu that (are located) behind Mount Nal. 
To the province of the chief cupbearer, I added the cities Enu, Sassu, Lups(u)a, Luqia, Šimirra, Ušurnu, Uzurra (Usuru), Auibi, (and) Ubula, as far as Mount Birda(n)ša. 
The lands Bīt-Ḫamban, Sumurzu, Bīt-Barrūa, Bīt-Zualzaš, Bīt-Matti,
The land Bīt-Ḫumria (Israel), all of whose cities I utterly devastated in former campaigns of mine, whose 
(and) livestock I carried off, and (whose capital) Samaria I isolated — (now) they overthrew Peqah, their king,
, chosen by the glance of the god Enlil, 
for my lordly residence and a bīt-ḫilāni, a replica of a palace of the land Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine), for my pleasure. I made the dimensions of its site 
I conquered the lands Ulluba (and) Ḫabḫu, which (are located) behind Mount Nal, in their entirety (and) annexed (them) to Assyria. I set up my royal image on (the face of) Mount Ilimeru. I built a city in the land Ulluba (and) I named it Aššur-iqīša. I brought the people of (foreign) lands conquered by me therein (and) placed a eunuch of mine as provincial governor over them
(As for) the land 
, from the cities Ququsanšu (and) Barzunna to the cities Ḫar(a)bisinna, Abbissâ, (and) Tasa, as far as the land Uluruš, which is above the bank of the Tigris River, the lands Lusia — the land of (the metal) lead — Amadīnu, 
Belonging to Yabâ, queen of Tiglath-pileser (III), king of Assyria.
Palace of Tiglath-pileser (III), great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria.
I raged up like a lion and became furious like the Deluge. With my merciless warriors, I set out for Kish against Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan). Moreover, he, (that) evildoer, saw the cloud of dust of my expeditionary force from afar and fear fell upon him. He abandoned all of his forces and fled to the land Guzummānu. 
Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of Assyria, unrivalled king, pious shepherd who reveres the great gods, guardian of truth who loves justice, renders assistance, goes to the aid of the weak, (and) strives after good deeds, perfect man, virile warrior, foremost of all rulers, the bridle that controls the insubmissive, (and) the one who strikes enemies with lightning: 
On my return march, I defeated all together the Tuʾumuna, Riḫiḫu, Yadaqqu, Ubudu, Gibrê, Maliḫu (Malaḫu), Gurumu, Ubulu, Damunu, (15) Gambulu, Ḫindaru, Ruʾuʾa, Puqudu, Ḫamrānu, Ḫagarānu, Nabatu, (and) Liʾtaʾu, insubmissive Arameans. I carried off into Assyria a substanial booty (consisting of) 208,000 people, male and female, 7,200 horses (and) mules, 11,073 donkeys, 5,230 camels, 80,100 oxen, (and) 800,600 sheep and goats.
I put to the sword the population of the city Ḫirimmu, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to my yoke, and I did not leave one alive. I reorganized that district (and) imposed for eternity one ox, ten sheep, ten homers of wine, (and) twenty homers of dates as his first-fruits offerings to the gods of Assyria, my lords. 
At that time, Nineveh, the exalted cult center, the city loved by the goddess Ištar in which all of the rituals for gods and goddesses are present; (35) the enduring foundation (and) eternal base whose plan had been designed by the stars (lit. “writing”) of the firmament and whose arrangement was made manifest since time immemorial; a sophisticated place (and) site of secret lore in which every kind of skilled craftsmanship, all of the rituals, (and) the secret(s) of the lalgar (cosmic subterranean water) are apprehended; 
In the hidden depths of its subterranean waters I bonded together, with bitumen, reeds below (and) strong mountain stone above, then I raised (that) area out of the water and converted (it) to dry land. (50) I filled in and measured a terrace of 700 large aslu-cubits along (its) longer side, 162 large aslu-cubits along (its) upper, northern shorter side, 217 large aslu-cubits along the inner, shorter side, (and) 386 large aslu-cubits along the lower, southern shorter side, (which is) beside the Tigris River. In order to prevent its foundation from being weakened over the passage of time by cresting flood(s), I surrounded its damp course with large limestone slabs (and thereby) reinforced its base. 
I inscribed objects bearing my name 160 courses of brick within the terrace and I deposited (them) deep down in its foundation for ever after.
(but) not one among them had paid heed to (or) shown interest in the palace inside it, the seat of lordly dwelling whose site had become too small; nor had anyone (of them) conceived of and put his mind towards the straightening of the city’s street(s) and the widening of (its) squares, the dredging of the river, (and) the planting of orchards:
The line count of the inscription is ... (lines)... , the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni, governor of the city Kurbail (699).
At any time (in the future), may one of my descendants (lit. “future children”), whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that wall becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur and the goddess Ištar will (then) hear his prayers.
I joyfully entered his palace, which is in Babylon, then I opened his treasury and brought out gold, silver, gold (and) silver utensils, precious stones, (i 5')  all kinds of possessions (and) property without number, a substantial tribute, (together with) his palace women, courtiers, attendants, male singers, female singers, all of the craftsmen, as many as there were, (and) his palace attendants, and I counted (them) as booty.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — (iv 55) became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array. He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, (iv 60) out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
For my lordly pleasure, I had a portico, a replica of a Hittite palace, (vi 70) which is called bīt-ḫilāni in the language of the land Amurru, constructed inside them.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, (i 80) who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. (i 85) In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull. 
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp). I proceeded through the gorges of the streams, the outflows of the mountains, (and) rugged slopes in (my) chair. (iv 30) Where it was too difficult for (my) chair, I leapt forward on my (own) two feet like a mountain goat. I ascended the highest peaks against them. Where my knees became tired, I sat down upon the mountain rock and drank cold water from a water skin to (quench) my thirst. 
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku (and) an insubmissive mountain-dweller. Before my time, none of the former kings of the past had marched through the untrodden paths (and) difficult trails on account of the rugged mountains. (iv 45) I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my crack combat troops, entered their narrow passes with great difficulty and ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
They besieged that city and (v 10) took possession of the city by means of piling up earth, bringing up battering rams, (and) the assault of foot soldiers. They counted the people, as well as the gods, living inside it as booty. They destroyed (and) devastated that city. They turned (it) into a mound of ruins (lit. “a mound and ruins”).
To make (those) planted areas luxuriant, I dug with picks a canal straight through high ground (and) low ground, from the border of the city Kisiru. (Thus) I provided a regular supply of those waters to the plain of Nineveh and (viii 30) I made (them) gush through small canals into those gardens.
Moreover, (as for) Hezekiah of the land Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, I surrounded (and) conquered forty-six of his fortified cities, fortresses, and small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number, by having (iii 20) ramps trodden down and battering rams brought up, the assault of foot soldiers, sapping, breaching, and siege engines. I brought out of them 200,150 people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, (iii 25) oxen, and sheep and goats, which were without number, and I counted (them) as booty.
Like a fierce wild bull, with my select bodyguard and my merciless combat troops, I took the lead of them (the soldiers in my camp)
cubits long (and) 
hundred and sixty large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger. Upon it, I filled in a terrace 190 courses of brick high.
I laid the foundation of its great wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu, (which means) “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies,” upon limestone and (vii 5') made (it) 40 bricks thick, measured by my large brick mold. Upwards (to the north) and downwards (to the south), I enlarged its battlements to (a width of) 39 bricks, then I raised its superstructure up high, to its copings, to (a height of) 200 courses of brick, (each of) whose thickness was one-third of a cubit, and (thus) raised (it) as high as a mountain. 
The month ... , ... day, eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691).
I carried off people, young (and) old, male and female, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep and goats without number, then I brought him (Ispabāra) to nought and made his land smaller. I detached from his land the cities Ṣi(ṣ)ṣirtu (and) Kummaḫlum, fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs (ii 25) (and) the district of the land Bīt-Barrû in its entirety, and I added (this area) to the territory of Assyria. 
As for him (Hezekiah), I confined him inside the city Jerusalem, his royal city, like a bird in a cage. I set up blockades against him and (iii 30) made him dread exiting his city gate. I detached from his land the cities of his that I had plundered and I gave (them) to Mitinti, the king of the city Ashdod, Padî, the king of the city Ekron, and Ṣilli-Bēl, the king of the city Gaza, and (thereby) made his land smaller. (iii 35) To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them (text: “him”).
They (the Babylonians) opened the treasury of Esagil and took out the gold (and) silver of the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Zarpanītu, the property of the temple of their gods. They sent it as a bribe to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam,  who does not have sense or insight, (saying): (v 35) “Gather your army, muster your forces, hurry to Babylon, and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you.”
As for Min(u)ḫimmu of the city Sam­si­mu­ru­na, Tu-Baʾ­lu of the city Sidon, Abdi-Liʾti of the city Arwad, (ii 50) Ūru-Milki of the city Byblos, Mitinti of the city Ashdod, Būdi-il of the land Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of the land Moab, Aya-rāmu of the land Edom, (ii 55) all of the kings of the land Amurru, they brought extensive gifts, four times (the normal amount), as their substantial audience gift before me and kissed my feet.
The god Adad (and) the goddess Šala, gods of the city Ekallātum whom Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, king of Akkad, had taken and brought to Babylon during the reign of Tiglath-pileser (I), king of Assyria — I had (them) brought out of Babylon after 418 years and I returned them to the city Ekallātum, their (proper) place.
dānu, (and) the distant Medes and I destroyed their settlements.
I took away the kingship of Lulî, the king of the city Sidon. I placed Tu-Baʾlu on his throne and imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship. 
With the ingenious mind that the lord of wisdom, the god Ninšiku, had granted to me, by divine will, I created clay molds for all of the bronze works that I intended to cast in Nineveh for the requirements of my palatial halls, then I poured copper into them (text “it”) and (80) my handiwork succeeded. Furthermore, I had twin lamassu-colossi of copper bear slabs of pendû-stone. I stationed (them) between the sphinxes, made (them) like battlements, and made (the façade) beautiful.
I made (that) armory extremely large, perfect, (and) splendid. I filled it with luxuriousness to be an object of wonder for all of the people. The surplus payment of all of the lands, (including) that of the distant Medes — from whom none of the kings, my ancestors, had received tribute — together with the wagons, chariots, vehicles of the king of the Elamites, the king of Babylon, and Chaldea that I had captured, along with the countless equipment (90) that I had accumulated: I had (all of these things) carried to the treasury of that palace and brought inside it.
At that time, the temple of 
... the Nergal Gate, which is opposite ... justice, who opens its gate.
In the corridors, I made openings for latticed windows. At their gates, I stationed apotropaic figures of alabaster (and) elephant ivory. I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails. I adorned the arches, friezes, and all of the copings with baked bricks (glazed in the color of) obsidian (and) lapis lazuli.
I decorated them with silver (and) copper knobbed nails
So that the construction of my palace might be carried out correctly and that my handiwork be completed, at that time, the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar, who love my priestly service (and) who selected me (lit. “who called my name”), revealed to me a source of trunks of cedar, which since distant days grew tall and very thick as they stood in seclusion in the Sirāra mountain range.
Moreover, breccia, as much as is needed (for making) burzigallu-bowls, 
I had large bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone created in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and their forms perfected through the craft of the deity Ninkura.
I fastened bands of copper on magnificent copper columns, as well as on large cedar columns, which are the product of Mount Amanus, and (then) I installed (them) upon lion colossi and positioned cross-beams (upon them) as a cornice for their gates.
At that time, I made the enemy people whom I had captured carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
By divine will, I created clay mold(s) of tree trunks and date palm(s), the tree of abundance, (of) twelve raging lions, as well as (of) twelve magnificent bull colossi with perfect features (and) twenty-two sphinxes that are coated in allure and charm (and) that have pride (and) exuberance heaped upon them, and I poured copper into it. Just like the cast work of (an object weighing only) a half shekel, I perfected their form(s).
I made bull colossi with copper features, two of which were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, (and) bull colossi of alabaster, together with bull colossi and sphinxes of white limestone, hold the door bolts of my palatial halls.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), (and) favorite of the great gods:
The covering of the roof that (hangs) over the corridors — I made their somber atmosphere cheerful, making (them) as bright as day. I decorated them with silver and copper knobbed nails.

They formed a confederation with the kings of Egypt (and) the archers, chariots, (and) horses of the king of the land Meluḫḫa, forces without number, and they came to their aid.

Through divination, at the command of the gods Šamaš and Adad, I built the akītu-house of the steppe for the qerītu-festival, which had been forgotten for a long time. I named it Eabbaugga, “House (where) Tiāmat Is Put to Death.” I named its cella Edubdubabba, “House that Makes the Host of Tiāmat Tremble.”

Furthermore, Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, agreed to help him (i 45) and they swore an oath by the great gods with one another and trusted in their own strength. I trusted in the god Aššur, my lord, caught him like a bird from the midst of the mountains, and cut off his head.

At that time, I, Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, the one selected (and) chosen by the god Aššur, the one required by the great gods, with the broad wisdom (and) vast comprehension that the sage of the gods, the prince, the god Nudimmud (Ea), gave to me, (and) through the great wisdom that the gods Aššur and Marduk imparted to me (lit. “opened my ears”) for refurbishing the great gods, (65) I prayed to the divinity of the god Aššur, king of the gods, and the great lord, the god Marduk, with raised hands, prayers, and expressions of humility, (saying):

As for me, Esarhaddon, the one who renewed the great gods, they decreed my fate (and) I made them enter Babylon in joy and rejoicing. I docked  Maumuša (“Boat of Command”) at the quay of Babylon.

They (the gods) entered the orchards, groves, canals, (and) gardens of Ekarzagina, a pure place (where) the craft of the sage, “the washing of the mouth,” “the opening of the mouth,” “bathing,” (and) “purification” (were recited) before the stars of heaven: the gods Ea, Šamaš, Asalluḫi, Bēlet-ilī, Kusu, Ningirima, Ninkurra, Ninagal, Kusibanda, Ninildu, (and) Ninzadim
In the future, in far-off days, may a future ruler, one of the kings, my descendants, renovate its dilapidated section(s). (60) May he read a foundation inscription written in my name, make an offering, anoint (it) with oil, write my name with his name, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Ninurta, son of the god Enlil, will (then) hear his prayers.

Later, Hazael died and I placed Iautaʾ (Iataʾ), his son, on his throne. I imposed upon him tribute and payment greater than the payment I fixed on his father.

At the beginning of my kingship, in my first year, when I sat in greatness on (my) royal throne, good signs were established for me; in heaven and on earth, he (the god Marduk) constantly sent me his omen(s). The angry gods were reconciled (and) they repeatedly disclosed favorable signs concerning the (re)building of Babylon (and) the renovation of Esagil.
By means of the great intelligence (and) vast understanding that the sage of the gods, the prince, the god Nudimmud, gave to me, it occurred to me to (re)populate that city, to renovate the shrines, (and) to make the cult center shine, and my heart prompted (me).
May the god Marduk and the goddess Zarpanītu, the gods, my helpers, look with joy upon my good deeds and bless (my) kingship in their steadfast heart(s). Let the seed of my priestly office endure (along) with the foundations of Esagil and Babylon; let (my) kingship be sustaining to the people forever like the plant of life so that I may shepherd their populace in truth and justice; (and) let me reach old age, attain extreme old age, (and) be sated with the prime of life until far-off days. Truly I am the provider.
May he (the god Marduk) make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land. May he have no pity on him forever.
The Enlil of the gods, the god Marduk, became angry and plotted evilly to level the land (and) to destroy its people. The river Araḫtu, (normally) a river of abundance, turned into a huge flood like the deluge, (and) swept (its) waters destructively across the city, its dwellings, (
The merciful god Marduk wrote that the calculated time of its abandonment (should last) 70 years, (but) his heart was quickly soothed, and he reversed the numbers and (thus) ordered its (re)occupation to be (after) 11 years.

his messenger 
They (my army) captured as many warships as there were with him, as well as his combat troops. A messenger told me the good news that I had been waiting for. To banish Taharqa from Egypt (and) Kush, I added to my former forces the chief eunuch, the governors, and all of the kings of Across the River (Syria-Palestine), together with their forces (and) their boats, (as well as) the kings of Egypt, servants who belonged to me, together with their boats (and) their forces, and I sent (them) to the city Thebes, 
meš, Zarzāta, Šanḫara, Sissil, Adumānu, Ḫallāya, Šeliḫiram, Šaḫarasiʾ, GubBAD, Matuḫanzaḫ, Taziʾ, Lušanda, LULbasta, (and) Babsaḫ, they covered those cities like a fog and overwhelmed (them) like a bird snare. They killed Tandāya, (their) city lord, and struck down his warriors with the sword. They carried off into Assyria people, (
They captured alive Akkudāya, their herald, (and) brought (him) before me. I forcibly removed the people living in those cities, took (them) and settled (them) in Egypt. I made the people, whom my bow plundered in another land, live in the city Qirbit and its villages.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the city Qirbit, which is inside (Mount) Ḫarēḫasta (lit. “the city Ḫarēḫasta”), since Tandāya, their city ruler, had never bowed down to the yoke of the kings, my ancestors, and the people living in the city Qirbit were constantly plundering the land Yamutbal. With the support of the gods Aššur, Bēl (Marduk), and Nabû, the gods, my lords, I conquered (and) plundered that city. (As for) Tandāya, their city ruler, I took (him) to Assyria together with captives from his city. I took the people of the city Qirbit, as many as I had carried off, and settled (them) in Egypt.
I leveled (and) burned with fire the district of the city Arsiyaniš, which is between the city Azaqanani and (lit. “of”) Mount Ḫarsi, which is before the land of the Kumurdeans, who are in the land Mannea. I killed Rayadišadî, their fortress commander, (and) I plundered it (Arsiyaniš).
Natnu, the king of the land of the Nabayateans — whose location is remote — heard about the might of the gods Aššur and Marduk, who had encouraged me. The one who had never sent his messenger to the kings, my ancestors, (and) had never inquired about the well-being of their royal majesties, (viii 50) he now sent to me his messenger with greetings (and) kissed my feet. He was constantly beseeching my lordly majesty to conclude a treaty (and) peace agreement, (and) to do obeisance to me. I myself looked with pleasure upon him and turned my benevolent face towards him. I imposed upon him annual tribute payment.

Throughout my entire land, (on account of) abundant trade, for (one) shekel of silver one could purchase  ten donkey-loads of grain, one homer of wine, two seahs of oil, (and) one talent of wool. Year after year, I shepherded the subjects of the god Enlil in prosperity and with justice.
Rulers (who reside in) the middle of the sea and kings who reside in the high mountains saw the might of these deeds of mine and became frightened of my lordly majesty. (As for) Yakīn-Lû, the king of the land Arwad, Mugallu, the king of the land Tabal, (ii 40') (and) Sanda-šarme of the land Ḫilakku (Cilicia), who had not bowed down to the kings, my ancestors, they bowed down to my yoke. (ii 45') They brought (their) daughters, their own offspring, to Nineveh to serve as housekeepers, together with a substantial dowry and a large marriage gift, and they kissed my feet. I imposed upon Mugallu an annual payment of large horses.
At that time, the wall of the citadel of Nineveh, which Sennacherib — king of Assyria, the father of the father who had engendered me — had built, (and, which) on account of abundant waters (and) heavy downpours that the god Adad had regularly brought yearly to my land during my reign, its foundation(s) had become weak and its superstructure had buckled. I removed the collapsed section(s) of that wall, which had become old (and) whose foundation(s) had become weak; I reached its lowest course. (viii 65) I strengthened its foundation(s) with massive (blocks of) mountain stone. I made that wall thicker than the previous one (and) I heaped (it) up like a mountain. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundation(s) to its crenellations. I strengthened its foundation(s) more than previously.
I (re)built Esagil, the palace of the gods, (and) completed its designs. I brought the deities Bēl (Marduk), Bēltīya (Zarpanītu), the Lady of Babylon, Ea, (and) Mandānu out of Ešarra (and) made (them) enter into Šuanna (Babylon).
I dismantled the outposts that I had constructed against Baʾalu, the king of the land Tyre. By sea and dry land, I opened (all of) his routes, as many as I had seized. I received from him his substantial payment. I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and returned safely to Nineveh, my capital city.
Within one year, they (all) laid down (their) live(s) at the same time. The angry heart of (the god) Aššur had not relented against them, nor had the mood of the goddess Ištar, who had encouraged me, become tranquil towards them. They overthrew his royal dynasty. They made somebody else assume dominion over the land Elam.
(As for) Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, 
Afterwards, Necho, Šarru-lū-dāri, (and) Pa-qruru sinned against my treaty (and) did not honor the oath(s sworn) by the great gods. They forgot my kindness and their heart(s) plotted evil (deeds). They spoke word(s) of treachery and decided (among) themselves on a profitless decision, saying: (ii 25'') “If they remove Taharqa from Egypt, how then can we (ourselves) stay?” To establish treaties and peace, they dispatched their mounted messenger(s) to Taharqa, the king of Kush, saying: “Let peace be established between us so that (ii 30'') we can come to a mutual agreement. (Let) us divide the land among ourselves so that no other lord comes between us.” With regard to troops of Assyria, the might of my lordly majesty, they constantly sought out evil plan(s) to cut (their) throat(s).
On my seventh campaign, I marched against Teumman, the king of the land Elam who had regularly sent his envoys to me concerning Ummanigaš, Ummanappa, (and) Tammarītu — the sons of Urtaku, the king of the land Elam — (and) Kudurru (and) Parrû — the sons of Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš II), the brother of Urtaku, (former) king of the land Elam — (asking me) to send (back) (v 55) those people who had fled to me and grasped my feet. I did not grant him their extradition. Concerning the aforementioned, he sent insults monthly by the hands of Umbadarâ and Nabû-damiq. (v 60) Inside the land Elam, he was bragging in the midst of his troops, saying: “I will not stop until I go (and) do battle with him.” As for these insolent words that Teumman had spoken, (v 65) they reported (this) news to me. I trusted in the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk) and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, who had encouraged me. I did not comply with the utterance(s) of his provocative speech (lit. “mouth”). I did not give him those fugitives.
“You, the divine lady of ladies, the goddess of war, the lady of battle, the advisor of the gods — her ancestors — the one who speaks good thing(s) about me before (the god) Aššur — the father who had engendered you — (so that) at the glance of his pure eyes he desired me to be king — with regard to Teumman, the king of the land Elam (v 115) who placed a burden on (the god) Aššur — the king of the gods, the father who had engendered you — he mustered his troops, prepared for battle, (and) is sharpening his weapons  in order to march to Assyria.”

Their possessions were ... (and) their ... property for (something to) eat. They could not satisfy (their) starvation (and) hunger (viii 10') (so) they ate dogs (and) mongooses. Their sin was great. They ate grass. (As for) the snake(s and) scorpion(s), as many creatures that there are on earth, (and) rodents, they brought them to an end. (viii 15') They gnawed on animal hides, (leather) straps, shoes and sandals. To (fight) their hunger, they slaughtered (their) sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, ... , all of them. (viii 20') Instead of bread, they ate the flesh of their sons. Instead of beer, they drank the blood of their daughters.

Natnu, the king of the land of the Nabayateans — whose location is remote — heard about the might of the gods Aššur and Marduk, who had encouraged me. The one who had never sent his messenger to the king<s>, my ancestors, and had never inquired about the well-being of my royal majesty — (x 35') after Iautaʾ, the king of the land of the Arabs, a servant who belonged to me, had fled to the land of the Nabayateans and came before Natnu, Natnu said the following to Iautaʾ, (x 40') saying: “Can I myself be spared from the grasp of Assyria? Nevertheless, you have made me your stronghold!” Natnu became frightened and distressed. (x 45') He sent his messengers to me to inquire about my well-being and kissed my feet. He was constantly beseeching my lordly majesty to conclude a treaty (and) peace agreement, (and) to do obeisance to me. I myself looked with pleasure upon him and (x 50') turned my benevolent face towards him. I imposed upon him annual tribute payment.
Afterwards, Necho, Šarru-lū-dāri, (and) Pa-qruru sinned against my treaty (and) did not honor the oath(s sworn) by the great gods. They forgot my kindness and their heart(s) plotted evil (deeds).

Iautaʾ, son of Hazael, the king of the land Qedar who does obeisance to me, approached me about his gods and
(As for) Aḫšēri, who did not fear my lordly majesty, (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar placed him in the hands of his servants. The people of his land incited a rebellion against him (and) they cast his corpse into a street of his city.
I conquered the city Banunu, together with the district of the city Tasarra, all (of it)... I conquered twenty villages in the district of the city Ḫunnir, (which is) on the border of the city Ḫidalu. I destroyed (and) demolished the city Bašimu and the villages in its environs.

I (re)built Esagil, the palace of the gods, (and) completed its designs. I brought the deities Bēl (Marduk), Bēltīya (Zarpanītu), the Lady of Babylon, Ea, (and) Mandānu out of Ešarra (and) made (them) enter into Šuanna (Babylon). 
(As for) the exalted chariot, the vehicle of the god Marduk, the pre-eminent one among the gods, the lord of lords, I completed its feature(s) with gold, silver, (and) precious stones. I gave (it) as a gift to the god Marduk, the king of the totality of heaven and netherworld, the one who overwhelms my enemies.
For the preservation of my life, I set up lion-headed eagles (and) divine emblems in the gateway(s) of Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal of the city Tarbiṣu.
I removed its dilapidated section(s) by the command of the gods Sîn (and) Nusku. I made its structure larger than the one in the days of the past. I built (and) completed (it) from its foundation(s) to its crenellations. Inside it, I built Emelamana, the temple of the god Nusku, the exalted vizier, which no king of the past (who had come) before me had built. I roofed them with long beams of cedar. I fastened band(s) of silver on doors of white cedar (and) I fixed (them) in their gateways. 
At that time, the akītu-house of the goddess Ištar, my lady, that is inside Nineveh — (the goddess) who raised me like (my own) birth-mother, killed my enemies, (and) made all of the rulers bow down at my feet — (and) which Sargon (II) — the grandfather of the father who had engendered me, descendant of Bēl-bāni, son of Adāsi, whose ultimate place of origin is Baltil (Aššur) — had built, had become old
(As for) those twenty kings who had constantly sought out evil (deeds) against the troops of Assyria, they brought (them alive) to Nineveh, before me.
My troops saw the Idide River, a raging torrent (and) were afraid to cross (it).

I confinedthem to one city, the city Arinu which is at the foot of Mount Aisa. They submitted to me (and) I spared that city. I imposed upon them hostages, tribute, (and) impost.
