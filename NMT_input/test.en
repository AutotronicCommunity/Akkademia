) I built a city in the land Ulluba (and) I named it Aššur-iqīša. Inside (it), I founded a palace for my royal residence. I set up the weapon of (the god) Aššur, my lord, therein, (and) settled the people of (foreign) lands conquered by me therein

Samsi became startled by my mighty weapons and she brought camels, she-camels, with their young, to Assyria, before me.
I confined Sarduri of the land Urarṭu to the city Ṭurušpâ, his city, and inflicted a great defeat upon him before his city gates. I fashioned my royal image and erected (it) in front of the city Ṭurušpâ. 
(As for) ... , ... who had not submitted to the kings, my predecessors, and who had not sent his message (to any of them), ... , heard about the conquest of the land Ḫatti (Syria-Palestine). The terrifying radiance of (the god) Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed him, and he became distressed. He sent his envoys to Kalḫu, before me, to do obeisance.
I smashed the land Bīt-Amukāni and brought all of its people to Assyria. I confined Mukīn-zēri, their king, to Sapīya (Šapīya), his city.

Belonging to Bānītu, queen of Shalmaneser (V), king of Assyria.
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, (and) the lands Que and Ḫilakku, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks. I cut down canebrakes in Chaldea and I had their splendid reeds hauled (to Nineveh) for its (the palace’s) construction by enemy soldiers whom I had defeated.
In the future, may one of the kings, my descendants, whom the god Aššur names for shepherding the land and people, renovate its dilapidated section(s) when that palace becomes old and dilapidated. May he find an inscribed object bearing my name, anoint (it) with oil, make an offering, (and) return (it) to its place. The god Aššur will (then) hear his prayers.
The line count of the inscription is 71 (lines). Sibūti, eponymy of Nabû-lēʾi, governor of the city Arbela (702).
With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 89 fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 820 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans and Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, (and) Cutha, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.
On my second campaign, the god Aššur, my lord, encouraged me and I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians, a dangerous enemy who since time immemorial had not submitted to the kings, my ancestors. In the high mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback and had my personal chariot carried on (men’s) necks. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull.
I made that city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ a fortress again (and) strengthened its enceinte more than before. I settled therein the people of the lands that I had conquered. (25) I brought down from the mountains the people of the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians who had fled from my weapons and I made (them) dwell in the cities Ḫardišpu (and) Bīt-Kubatti. I placed them under the authority of a eunuch of mine, the governor of the city Arrapḫa. I had a stele made, had all the victorious conquests that I achieved over them written on it, and I erected (it) in (that) city. 
To plant gardens, I subdivided the meadowland upstream of the city into plots of two pānu each for the citizens of Nineveh and I handed (them) over to them. 
its foundations 
So that there would be outflow from the Ḫusur River in the city (and) the passage of water upstream and downstream, I built aqueducts beneath it (the city wall) with baked bricks, 
On my return march, I received a substantial payment from the distant Medes, of whose land none of the kings, my ancestors, had heard mention. (Thus) I made them bow down to the yoke of my lordship.
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons (iv 30') and my fierce battle array, then dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. He flew away like a bird to (the city) Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, (v 1) which is in the swamps (and) marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.
From the booty of those lands that I had plundered, I conscripted 20,000 archers (and) 15,000 shield bearers and added (them) to my royal contingent. I divided up the rest of the substantial enemy booty (v 15) like sheep and goats among my entire camp (and) my governors, (and) the people of my great cult centers.
I opened up a foundation pit for the outer wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa, (which means) “Terrorizer of Enemies,” then I dug down forty-five nindanu and made (it) reach the water table. I bound together strong mountain stone in the water below and above I expertly carried out its construction with large limestone (blocks) up to its copings.

The month 
I placed Tu-Baʾlu on the royal throne over them and imposed upon him tribute (and) payment (in recognition) of my overlordship (to be delivered) yearly (and) without interruption.
Moreover, (as for) Ṣidqâ, the king of the city Ashkelon who had not bowed down to my yoke, I forcibly removed the gods of his father’s house, himself, his wife, his sons, his daughters, his brothers, (and other) offspring of his father’s house (iii 30) and took him to Assyria. 
(But) as for me, Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, the performing of this work came to my attention by the will of the gods and I put my mind to it. I forcibly removed the people of Chaldea, Aramean (tribes), the land of the Manneans, the lands Que, Ḫilakku, (and) Philistia, and the city Tyre, who had not submitted to my yoke, then I made them carry baskets (of earth) and they made bricks.
I had fourteen gates opened up in it in four directions, in front and behind, (and) along both sides, for entering and leaving.
The former palace, whose extent was 360 cubits on (its) longer side (and) 95 cubits on (its) shorter side, and (v 60) whose site was too small; which earlier kings, my ancestors, had had constructed for their lordly dwelling, but whose construction they had carried out inexpertly:
The Ḫusur River, whose waters since time immemorial had been deep and which none of the kings, my ancestors, had confined (i.e., made its water flow through a canal) so that they (the waters of the Ḫusur) poured into the Tigris River:
In the thick of battle, I captured alive the Egyptian charioteers and princes (lit. “the sons of the king”), together with the charioteers of the king of the land Meluḫḫa.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, then I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my lordship.
I quickly slaughtered and defeated Ḫumban-undaša, (... )

On my first campaign, I brought about the defeat of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Me­ro­dach-ba­la­dan), king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), together with the troops of (the land) Elam, his allies, in the plain of Kish. In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. (i 25) I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I pursued them on the peaks of the mountains and defeated them. I conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire their cities.
together with the cities of the passes, namely Bīt-Bunaki, Tīl-Ḫumbi, Dimtu-ša-Dume-ili, Bīt-Ubiya, Baltī-līšir, Taqab-līšir, Ša-nāqidāte, Ma­sū­tu-šaplīti, Sarḫudēri, Ālum-ša-Bēlet-bīti, (iv 75) Bīt-Aḫḫē-iddina, (and) Ilteuba — I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire (those) thirty-four fortified cities, together with the small(er) settlements in their environs, which were without number. I made the smoke from their conflagration cover the wide heavens like a heavy cloud.
I roofed them with magnificent beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus, the holy mountain. I fastened bands of bright copper on doors of white cedar and I installed (them) in their gates. I had magnificent bull colossi fashioned from white limestone that was discovered in the territory of the city Balāṭāya and on the right and left I made (them) hold their door bolts.
The cities Bubê, Dunni-Šamaš, Bīt-Risiya, Bīt-Aḫlamê, (iv 55) Dūru, Dannat-Sulāya, Šilibtu, Bīt-Aṣusi, Kār-Zēra-iqīša, Bīt-Giṣṣi, Bīt-Kat­pa­lā­ni, Bīt-Imbiya, Ḫamānu, Bīt-Arrabi, Bu­ru­tu, Dim­tu-ša-Sulāya, Dimtu-ša-Mār-bīti-ēṭir, Ḫarri-ašlakê, (iv 60) Rabbāya, Rāsu, Akkabarina, Tīl-Uḫuri, Ḫamrānu, Na­dī­tu,
The god Aššur, the great mountain, granted to me unrivalled sovereignty and made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises. He made all of the black-headed (people) from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun bow down at my feet. (i 15) Thus did recalcitrant rulers come to fear battle with me. While they were abandoning their settlements, they flew away alone like bats (living) in crevices to inaccessible place(s).
... (... ) (As for) the rest of his magnates, including Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), who had raised their arms because they were terrified of doing battle with me, I captured them alive in the thick of battle. 
... I conquered his (Marduk-apla-iddina II’s) entire land and I counted (his people) as booty. I destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his cities... in the city Nagītu, where he was residing, fear of (my lordly) brilliance overwhelmed him and he (Marduk-apla-iddina II) disappeared.
(As for) the king of the land Elam, who had come to the aid of the Babylonians, I marched to his land. I surrounded, conquered, plundered, destroyed, devastated, (and) burned with fire his fortified cities, his treasury, and the small(er) settlements in their environs, as far as the pass of the land Bīt-Bunaki.
Palace of Sennacherib, great king, strong king, king of the world, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), favorite of the great gods: 
I raised its superstructure in its entirety 190 courses of brick. I enlarged the structure of the palace to 700 large cubits along (its) longer side and 440 large cubits along (its) shorter side and (thus) I made its site bigger.
Near Nineveh, in the territory of the city Balāṭāya, by divine will, white limestone was discovered in abundance, and (then) I created bull colossi and (other) statues with limbs of alabaster that are sculpted from a single stone, (whose) proportions are perfect, (and) who stand high on their own pedestals; sphinxes of alabaster whose features are exquisite (and) whose bodies shine like a brilliant day; (and) magnificent slabs of breccia. I cut (them) free on both sides from their mountains, and (then), for the construction of my palace, I had (them) dragged into Nineveh.
The Tebilti River, a tempestuous flood (of water) which had flowed from distant days by the side of the palace (and) had shaken its base when its flood was in full spate: 
In a pitched battled, I repulsed Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), the king of Karduniaš (Babylonia), (and) took away his rulership. I killed with the sword all of the Chaldeans, together with the massed body of Elamite troops, his allies.
I uprooted all of the Aḫlamû (Arameans) (and) Sutians. I put to the sword the inhabitants of the city Ḫirimmu, not sparing (any of) their offspring. I conquered (the land of) the Yasubigallians, a dangerous enemy. I ruined the land Ellipi and destroyed its settlements.
Sphinxes of alabaster, as well as sphinxes of cast urudû-copper that were overlaid with zaḫalû-silver, and sphinxes of cast ... -metal, whose features were brilliant: I erected over them columns of ebony, cypress, cedar, daprānu-juniper, juniper, and Indian wood, with pašallu-gold and silver inlays, and (then) I positioned the architraves of the inner rooms of my lordly residence (on those columns). 
On my second campaign, I marched to the land of the Kassites and the land of the Yasubigallians. In the mountains, difficult terrain, I rode on horseback. In very rugged terrain I roamed about on foot like a wild bull. 
I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road against Maniye, the insubmissive king of the city Ukku. None of the kings of the past, (who came) before me, had marched through the difficult paths on account of the rugged mountains. I had my camp pitched at the foot of Mount Anara and Mount Uppa, mighty mountains, and I myself, in an armchair, with my combat troops, ascended with a struggle the steep mountain peaks.
I roofed them (the palatial halls) with beams of cedar (and) cypress. I fastened bands of silver (and) copper on doors of white cedar (and) cypress and I installed (them) in their gates. 
So that the construction of my palace 
Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, built a house in connection with the start of the work on the wall of Nineveh for his son and gave (it to him).

In the midst of that battle he abandoned his camp, fled alone, and (thereby) saved his life. I seized the chariots, horses, wagons, (and) mules that he had abandoned in the thick of battle.
I set Šarru-lū-dāri, son of Rūkibtu, their former king, over the people of the city Ashkelon and imposed upon him the payment of tribute (and) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship so that he (now) pulls my yoke.
I brought out Padî, their king, from the city Jerusalem and placed (him) on the lordly throne over them, and (then) I imposed upon him payment (in recognition) of my overlordship.
I ruined the wide district of the land Judah (and) imposed my yoke on Hezekiah, its king.
... The wheels of my war chariot, (which lays criminals and villains low), were bathed in blood and gore. I filled the plain with the corpses of their warriors like grass. I cut off (their) lips and (thus destroyed their pride). I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers.
To Babylon, which was very guilty, ... (wherein) Šūzubu, a Chaldean, son of a nobody, a person of lowly status who has no strength, ... , was appointed as ... of Babylon: The people of Babylon who had rebelled (and) the Chaldeans, Arameans, (... ) fugitives, (and) runaways who had banded together with them in exchange for gifts and bribes ... and they took an oath.

With the strength of the god Aššur, my lord, I surrounded, conquered, (and) plundered 75 of his fortified cities, fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 small(er) settlements in their environs. I brought out the auxiliary forces of the Arameans (and) Chaldeans who were in Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Ḫursagkalama, Cutha, (and) Sippar, together with the guilty citizens, and I counted (them) as booty.

Now I, Sennacherib — king of Assyria, foremost of all rulers, who marched about freely from east to west — thanks to the waters of the canals that I caused to be dug,  I could plant around Nineveh gardens, vines, every type of fruit, ... , products of every mountain, fruit trees from all over the world, (including) spices and olive trees. Where water could not reach, I left waterless and ... a game preserve called ... all of the orchards, for entering the fields, above the city (and) below (the city), <from> the city Tarbiṣu to the city of the people of the Inner City (Aššur), I provided irrigation annually for the cultivation of grain and sesame.

in a pitched battle 
On my eighth campaign, I ordered the march to Babylon. (As for) the Babylonians who heard about the approach of my expeditionary force, terror and fear fell upon them. They opened the treasury of Esagil and took out the gold, silver, (and) choice stones of the god Bēl (Marduk) and the goddess Zarpanītu in abundance. They sent (it) to Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam. They wrote to him as follows: “Come to Babylon to our aid and align yourself with us! Let us put our trust in you!”
After my (departure), he, the king of the land Elam, roused ...

So that no one will ever forget the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) that all humanity might magnify the praise of his heroism, on the (very) spot where I defeated the king of Babylon and Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of the land Elam, all of their lands, together with the lands Parsuaš, Anzan, Paširu, Ellipi, all of Chaldea, as many as there were, (and) all of the Arameans, I reaped their skulls like withered grain and piled (them) up like pyramids.

I am my older brothers’ youngest brother (and) by the command of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, and Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, (my) father, who engendered me, elevated me firmly in the assembly of my brothers, saying: ‘This is the son who will succeed me.’ He questioned the gods Šamaš and Adad by divination, and they answered him with a firm ‘yes,’ saying: ‘He is your replacement.’ (i 15) He heeded their important word(s) and gathered together the people of Assyria, young (and) old, (and) my brothers, the seed of the house of my father. 
In Addaru (XII), a favorable month, on the eighth day, the eššēšu-festival of the god Nabû, I joyfully entered Nineveh, my capital city, and I sat happily on the throne of my father. The south wind, the breeze of the god Ea, the wind whose blowing is favorable for exercising kingship, blew upon me. (ii 5) Favorable signs came in good time to me in heaven and on earth. They (the gods) continually and regularly encouraged me with oracles through ecstatics, the message(s) of the gods and goddess(es). I sought out every one of the guilty soldiers, who wrongly incited my brothers to exercise kingship over Assyria, and imposed a grievous punishment on them: I exterminated their offspring.
I am Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, valiant warrior, foremost of all rulers, son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, (ii 15) descendant of Sargon (II), king of the world (and) king of Assyria, creation of the god Aššur (and) the goddess Mullissu, beloved of the gods Sîn and Šamaš, chosen by the gods Nabû (and) Marduk, favorite of the goddess Ištar — the queen — desired by the great gods, capable, able, intelligent, learned, the one whom the great gods (ii 20) raised to be king in order to restore the great gods and to complete the shrines of all of the cult centers of the great gods; the one who (re)constructed the temple of the god Aššur, (re)built Esagil and Babylon, (and) restored the gods and goddess(es) who (live) in it; the one who returned the plundered gods of the lands from the city Aššur to their (proper) place and let (them) dwell in security — 
I placed crossbeams on large copper columns (and) tall cedar columns, (thus forming) a cornice in their gates. I had the frieze(s) (and) coping(s) of the whole of that palace made of black and blue (glazed bricks) and I put (them) around (it) like a wreath. I surrounded all of the gates with an arch and a vault like a rainbow. I embedded nails of silver, gold, and shining copper in them. Through the craft of the sculptor, I depicted on it (the frieze of the palace) the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) the deeds that I had accomplished in enemy lands. 
(As for) the land Bāzu, a district in a remote place, a forgotten place of dry land, saline ground, a place of thirst, one hundred and forty leagues of desert, thistles, and gazelle-tooth stones, twenty leagues of land where snakes and scorpions fill the plain like ants — (iii 15) I left mount Ḫazû, the mountain of saggilmud-stone, twenty leagues behind me and crossed over (to that district) to which no king before me had gone since earliest days. By the command of the god Aššur, my lord, (iii 20) I marched triumphantly in its midst. I defeated eight kings from that district (and) carried off their gods, their goods, their possessions, (and) their people to Assyria. Laialê, king of the city Iadiʾ, (iii 25) who had fled before my weapons, heard of the plundering of his gods and came to Nineveh, my capital city, before me, and kissed my feet. (iii 30) I had pity on him and said to him ‘Aḫulap!’ I inscribed the might of the god Aššur, my lord, on his gods that I had carried off and I gave (them) back to him. I put that province of Bāzu under him (and) imposed on him my lordly tribute (and) payment.
The one who plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the district of the Brook of Egypt — I threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors and brought (them) to Assyria. I seated them, bound, near the citadel gate of (the city of) Nineveh along with bear(s), dog(s), and pig(s). 
After the gods Aššur, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela made me stand victoriously over my enemies and I attained everything I wanted, with the booty of the vast enemies which my hands had captured (iv 25')  through the help of the great gods, my lords, I had the shrines of cult centers built in Assyria and Akkad; I decorated (them) with silver (and) gold and made (them) shine like daylight. 
... when they were coming to Nineveh ... when they were clothing him in linen (and) garments with multicolored trim, putting gold rings on his hands (and) ... his ... , (then) he (no longer) said ‘woe!’ and (no longer) uttered cries of mourning. 
“For each runaway Assyrian fugitive, let me replace him one hundred-fold. Let me live so that I may proclaim the fame of the god Aššur (and) praise your heroism. May the one who is neglectful of the god Aššur, king of the gods, the one who does not listen to the word of Esarhaddon, king of the world, his lord, (and) the one who does not return runaway Assyrian fugitives to his owner, learn from my example. (i 20) (I said) thus: ‘The nobles, my advisors, spoke unwholesome lies to me. (Consequently) I committed a great sin against the god Aššur and (thus) I did not listen to the word of the king, my lord, did not return to you the citizens of Assyria, your servants, nor did I do myself (any) good. (Now) the oath of the great gods, which I transgressed, (and) the word of your kingship, which I despised, have caught up with me. May the anger of your heart be appeased. Have mercy on me and remove my punishment!’”
thus I said to him, (saying): “Did you ever hear a mighty king (give his) order twice? But I am an almighty king (and) I have written to you three times (and) you have not listened to the words of my lips! You had no fear of deceiving me and you paid no attention to my message(s). You began war and battle against me and (by so doing) you called up the fierce weapons of the god Aššur from their sheaths.”
Thus I wrote him (the king of Šubria), (saying): “These ... before an offering. Like an idiot ... you bathe after your offerings! Like ... you put in drain pipes after the rain! Thus ... the highest divine orders have been spoken twice. Your days have elapsed! Your ... has arrived! Your appointed time is here! Let ... be ... At the command of the gods of heaven (and) netherworld ... came forth for the destruction of your land. (ii 35) ... the carrying off of your people was decreed... is firmly fixed and its place cannot be changed... who appeases the heart of the god ... , ... did not turn back ... their utterances.” ... I did not say ‘Aḫulap!’ to him ... my angry mood
... concerning the Urarṭians who had fled from Urarṭu to the land Šubria and about whom Ursa, king of Urarṭu, wrote, he (the king of Šubria) did not listen to his command, (iii 30') did not agree to give (them back), wrote to him (Ursa) in anger, and replied with hostility. After I captured the land Šubria with the help of the god Aššur, my lord, and counted his people as booty, in order to keep the treaty and because of the truth and justice the great gods gave to me, I inquired, questioned, investigated, (and) denounced those people. I did not hold back a single Urarṭian fugitive (and) not one escaped. I returned them to their land.
... I divided that land in two, and placed two of my officials over them as governors. I settled in it ... I placed Bi-ilu in the city Uppume ... (and) Bēl-iddina in the city Kullimmeri. I restored (it) to Assyrian territory (and) reorganized that province. I imposed the tribute (and) payment of my lordship yearly, without ceasing upon them.

(As for) Baltil (Aššur), the foremost cult city, whose privileged status had been established with (that of) the people of Anu (and) Enlil from early days and (ii 35) whose kanakku-status ... — I, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, love the inhabitants of Baltil (Aššur) (ii 40) like my own precious life (and thus) it occurred to me and my heart prompted me to greatly increase their freedom more than before.
I had the god Aššur, king of the gods, dwell in his lordly, sublime chapel on (his) eternal dais (and) I placed the gods Ninurta, Nusku, (and all of) the gods (and) goddesses in their stations (vi 35) to the right and left. I slaughtered a fattened bull (and) butchered sheep; I killed birds of the heavens and fish from the apsû, (vii 1) without number; (and) I piled up before them the harvest of the sea (and) the abundance of the mountains. The burning of incense, (vii 5) a fragrance of sweet resin, covered the wide heavens like heavy fog. I presented them with gifts from the inhabited settlements, (vii 10) (their) heavy audience gift(s), and I gave (them) gifts. I banned access to A.RI.A.TA.BAR, (that is) ‘Foreign Seed,’ from its midst and appeased his (Aššur’s) anger.
The god Aššur, king of the gods, truly looked on my good deeds and (vii 20) his heart became joyful, his mood shone. He blessed me with a blessing of long days and (vii 25) named me as the builder of the temple. I, together with my nobles (and) the people of my land, (vii 30) held a celebration in the courtyard of Ešarra for three days. I appeased the heart of his great divinity and placated his mood.
I made foundation inscriptions, wrote the deeds that I had done on them, and left (them) forever for future kings, my descendants.
The palace of Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, son of Sennacherib, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria — I had the gatehouse, which is in the palace in Baltil (Aššur), built anew for coming and going (and) I firmly founded its foundation with white limestone.
The palace of Esarhaddon, great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, son of Sennacherib, king of the world (and) king of Assyria, descendant of Sargon (II), king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad — an amphora filled with oil fit for princes, which was with the vast possessions (and) goods without number, the treasures of the palace of Abdi-Milkūti, the king of Sidon — which is in the midst of the sea — that my great hand(s) captured with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl, Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela.
I made foundation inscriptions, had the might of the god Aššur, my lord, (and) the deeds that I had done written on them, and placed (these inscriptions) in them (the foundations).
The king, who with the help of the gods Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Nabû, Marduk, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, marched freely from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and made all of his enemies and the rulers who were unsubmissive to him bow down at his feet; the one who conquered the city Sidon, which is in the midst of the sea, (and) the one who leveled all of its dwellings; the one who plundered the city Arzâ, which is in the neighborhood of the Brook of Egypt, (and) who threw Asuḫīli, its king, into fetters along with his counselors (and) brought (them) to Assyria; moreover, (I am) the one who struck with the sword Teušpa, a Cimmerian, together with his entire army, in the territory of the land Ḫubušna; the one who treads on the unsubmissive people of Cilicia;
I had a stele made, and ... my victory (and) triumph ... 
You truly selected me, Esarhaddon, in the assembly of my older brothers to put these matters right, and you (are the one) who placed your sweet protection over me, swept away all of my enemies like a flood, killed all of my foes and made me attain my wish, (and), to appease the heart of your great divinity (and) to please your spirit, you entrusted me with shepherding Assyria.
(As for) the one who changes (an inscription) written in my name, defaces my representations, annuls the privileged status of Babylon, (and) breaks the covenant of the lord of lords, may the god Marduk, the Enlil of the gods, the lord of the lands, look with fury on him and order his destruction among all of the black-headed people. May he (the god Marduk) make his word bad in Ubšukkinnaku, the courtyard of the assembly of the gods, the place of council, (and) order that his life not last (even) a single day.
He (the god Marduk) ordered me to complete the cult centers, to renovate the shrines, (and) to organize well the rites of Esagil, the palace of the gods. Every month, the gods Sîn and Šamaš together, at their appearance, answered me with a firm ‘yes’ concerning the avenging of Akkad. 
At that time, in the reign of a king who preceded me, bad omens occurred.

For the god Marduk, his lord: Esarhaddon, king of Assyria (and) king of Babylon, had baked bricks made anew for Esagil and Babylon.
May the goddess Gula, ... , look upon this work of mine with pleasure and
If at any time in the future, during the days of the reign of some future ruler, this temple falls into disrepair and becomes dilapidated, may (that ruler) seek out its (original) emplacement (and) repair its dilapidated parts! May he anoint an inscription written in my name with oil, make an offering, (and) set (it) back in its place! The gods will (then) hear his prayers. He will lengthen (his) days (and) enlarge (his) family.
(But as for) the one who erases my inscribed name by some crafty device, destroys my (royal) inscription, or changes its position, may the goddess Ištar of Uruk glare at him angrily and determine a bad fate for him! May she make his name (and) his descendant(s) disappear from the land and have no pity on him!

Silver, gold, precious stones, as much property of his palace as there was, garment(s) with multi-colored trim, linen garments, large horses, people — male and female — (ii 30) two tall obelisks cast with shiny zaḫalû-metal, whose weight was 2,500 talents (and which) stood at a temple gate, I ripped (them) from where they were erected and took (them) to Assyria. I carried off substantial booty, (which was) without number, from inside the city Thebes. (ii 35) I made my weapons prevail over Egypt and Kush and (thus) achieved victory. With full hand(s), I returned safely to Nineveh, my capital city.
On my eighth campaign, I marched against Dunānu, son of Bēl-iqīša, to the land Gambulu, which had put its trust in the king of the land Elam (and) had not bowed down to my yoke. With my mighty battle array, (vi 15) I covered the land Gambulu in its entirety like a fog. I conquered the city Ša-pī-Bēl, his fortified city, whose location is situated between rivers.
On my fourth campaign, I marched to the city Qirbit, which is inside (Mount) Ḫarēḫasta (lit. “the city Ḫarēḫasta”), since Tandāya, (iii 1) their city ruler, had never bowed down to the yoke of the kings, my ancestors, and the people living in the city Qirbit were constantly plundering the land Yamutbal. With the support of the gods Aššur, Bēl (Marduk), (and) Sîn, the gods, my lords, I conquered (and) plundered that city. (As for) Tandāya, their city ruler, I took (him) to Assyria together with captives from his city. I took the people of the city Qirbit, as many as I had carried off, and settled (them) in Egypt.
At that time, (as for) Birisḫatri, a city ruler of the Medes, (and) Sarati  (and) Pariḫi, two sons of Gagî, a city ruler of the land Saḫi, who had cast off the yoke of my lordship, I conquered (and) plundered seventy-five of their fortified cities. I captured them alive (and) brought (them) to Nineveh, my capital city.
(As for) the exalted chariot, the vehicle of the god Marduk, the pre-eminent one among the gods, the lord of lords, I completed its feature(s) with gold, silver, (and) precious stones. I gave (it) as a gift to the god Marduk, the king of the totality of heaven and netherworld, the one who overwhelms my enemies.
I asked the gods Šamaš (and) Adad and they answered me with a firm “yes.” I refurbished the emblem of her great divinity (and) made her sit upon a throne-dais as (her) eternal abode. I firmly (re)-established her precious cultic ordinances and properly carried out her cultic rites.

(iv 15') With the support of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (and) Ištar of Arbela, I conquered (and) plundered that city.

The goddess Šarrat-Kidmuri, who in her anger had abandoned her inner sanctum (and) had taken up residence in a place not befitting her, relented during the favorable reign (lit. “my favorable reign”) that (the god) Aššur had granted me. (i 25') To complete (the emblem of) her exalted divinity (and) to glorify her precious cultic rites, she constantly kept sending me (instructions) through dream(s and) message(s) from ecstatics.
I completed the sanctuaries of Assyria and the land Akkad in their entirety. I made every type of temple appurtenance there is from silver (and) gold, (and) I added (them) to those of the kings, my ancestors. (i 70') I made the great gods who support me reside in their exalted inner sanctums. I offered sumptuous offerings before them (and) presented (them) with my gifts. I made regular offerings (and) contributions more plentiful than those of distant days.
Rulers (who reside in) the middle of the sea and kings who reside in the high mountains saw the might of these deeds of mine and
During the month Abu (V) — the month of the heliacal rising of the Bow Star, the festival of the honored queen, the daughter of the god Enlil (the goddess Ištar) — (v 85) to revere her great divinity, I resided in the city Arbela, the city that her heart loves, (when) they reported to me news concerning an Elamite attack, which he (Teumman) had started against me without divine approval, saying: (v 90) “Teumman, whose judgement the goddess Ištar had clouded (lit. “altered”), spoke as follows, (the words) that he had said, saying: ‘I will not stop until I go (and) do battle with him.’”
Before me, Teumman, the king of the land Elam, set up camp in the city Bīt-Imbî. He heard about the entry of my royal majesty into (the city) Dēr and
On my tenth campaign, I marched to the land Elam... In the course of my campaign, I conquered the city Bīt-Imbî, (a city upon which the land Elam relied)... it ... 
I had statues of my royal majesty skillfully made from silver, gold, (and) shiny copper through the craft of the deities Ninagal, Kusibanda, (and) Ninkurra, and, (i 15') as constant petitioners for my life, I installed (them) in their positions before the gods who support me. From my childhood until I became an adult, I was assiduous towards the sanctuaries of the great gods. They required my priestly services (and) they (now) enjoy my giving (them) food offerings.
Eunuchs of mine heard these words; they seized their mounted messenger(s) along with their messages and
Afterwards, Uallî, his son, sat on his throne. He saw the might of the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal, (and) Nusku, the great gods, my lords, and bowed down to my yoke. (ii 45) For the preservation of his (own) life, he opened up his hands to me (and) made an appeal to my lordly majesty. He sent Erisinni, his heir designate, to Nineveh and he kissed my feet. I had mercy on him. I dispatched my messenger with (a message of) goodwill to him. He sent me (his) daughter, his own offspring, to serve as a housekeeper. (ii 50) (As for) his former payment, which they had discontinued in the time of the kings, my ancestors, they carried (it) before me. I added thirty horses to his former payment and imposed (it) upon him.
After I had made the weapon(s) of (the god) Aššur and the goddess Ištar prevail over the land Elam (and) had continually established mighty victories, on my return march, (ii 75) I set out towards Dunānu, a Gambulian who had put his trust in the land Elam. I conquered the city Ša-pī-Bēl, a city upon which the land Gambulu relied. I entered that city (and) slaughtered its people like lambs. (As for) Dunānu (and) Samgunu, the ones who had disturbed my exercising the kingship, (iii 1) I clamped (their) hands and feet in iron manacles (and) handcuffs (and) iron fetters. I carried off people, oxen and sheep and goats, donkeys, horses, (and) mules out of the land Gambulu to Assyria. (As for) Ša-pī-Bēl, the city upon which he (Dunānu) relied, I destroyed, demolished, (and) dissolved (it) with water.
Tammarītu handed himself over to do obeisance to me and, by the command of (the god)  Aššur and the goddess Ištar, he made an appeal to my lordly majesty to decide his case (and) to come to his aid. He stood before me and was singing the praises of the valor of my mighty gods, who had come to my aid.

May they kill my enemies, (and) cut down my foes. With their great support, may I rule wherever I desire (lit. “I say”) (and) achieve whatever (lit. “the place”) I strive for.

(x 30) They pulled (it) up to the gate of the temple while I was seated above them (lit. “while (they were) below me”). (There) I humbled myself (lit. “I stroked my nose”) (and) paid careful attention to their divinity. In a rally of my troops, I made visible their (the god’s) strength, (through) which the deities Aššur, Sîn, Šamaš, Adad, Bēl (Marduk), Nabû, Ištar of Nineveh, (x 35) Šarrat-Kidmuri, Ištar of Arbela, Ninurta, Nergal, (and) Nusku made those insubmissive to me bow down to my yoke (and) made me stand over my enemies in mighty victories.
At that time, the replacement House of Succession, the palace that is inside Nineveh — the exalted city loved by the goddess Mullissu — which Sennacherib, king of Assyria, the father of the father who had engendered me, had renovated to be his royal residence — that House of Succession became old during joyous celebrations, (and) its walls had become dilapidated.

In my first regnal year I crossed the Euphrates in flood (and) marched to the western sea. I washed my weapons in the sea (and) made sacrifices to my gods. I climbed up the Amanus range (and) cut beams of cedar (and) juniper. (i 45) I climbed up Mount Lallar (and) erected therein my royal statue. I razed, destroyed, (and) burned the cities of the Patineans, of Aḫunu, the man of Bīt-Adini, of the Carchemishites, (and) of the Bīt-(A)gūsi, which are on the other side of the Euphrates.
In my tenth regnal year I crossed the Euphrates for the eighth time. I razed, destroyed, (and) burned the cities of Sangara, the Carchemishite. Moving on from the cities of the Carchemishite I approached the cities of Aramu (and) captured the city Arne, his royal city. I razed, destroyed, (and) burned (it) together with one hundred cities in its environs. (ii 60) I massacred them (and) plundered them. At that time, Hadad-ezer (Adad-idri), the Damascene, (and) Irḫulēnu, the Ḫamatite, together with twelve kings on the shore of the sea, trusting in their united forces, attacked me to wage war and battle. I fought with them (and) (ii 65) defeated them. I took from them their chariotry, cavalry, and military equipment. To save their lives they ran away.
Shalmaneser, strong king, governor (appointed by) the great gods, son of Ashurnasirpal (II), king of Assyria, son of Tukultī-Ninurta (II), (who was) also king of Assyria; conqueror from the upper sea to the lower sea of the land Nairi, and the great sea of the west, from Mount Amanus, as far as Mount Lebanon, I gained dominion over all of the land Ḫatti. I conquered from the source of the Tigris to the source of the Euphrates. I conquered from the land Enzi, the lands Suḫni, Melid, Tummu, Daiēnu, Urarṭu, as far as Arṣaškun, the royal city of Aramu, the Urarṭian. I overwhelmed like a flood the lands Gilzānu (and) Ḫubuškia. I raged like fire from Mount Kullar as far as the lands Munna, Parsua, Allabria, Abdadānu, Namri, Ḫaban, as far as the land Tugliaš.
In the future may a later prince ... hear of my heroic deeds (and) recount my praiseworthy power  As I anointed with oil, made sacrifices, (and) returned the monumental inscriptions of former kings to their places,
Shalmaneser ... the universe,
They abandoned their cities and fled into the mountains and forests,
The king sat down with joy upon the lion’s seat in the city Baltil (Aššur),
I defeated Hadad-ezer (Adad-idri), the Damascene, together with twelve princes who were his allies. I laid low like sheep 29,000 of his brave warriors (and) threw the remnant of his troops into the Orontes. They fled to save their lives.
May a later prince restore its ruined (portions) (and) return my inscription to its place. (Then) the gods Aššur (and) Adad, the great gods, will listen to his prayers. May he return my clay cone to its place.

At the beginning of my sovereignty (lit. at the beginning of the throne of my sovereignty), at the beginning of my reign, I uprooted 28,800 Hittite people from Syria (lit. “Beyond the Euphrates”) and led (them) into my land... I conquered the lands of the Papḫu (and) Uqumanu as far as the lands Šarnida (and) Meḫru. Annually I regularly received the tribute of their lands and the produce of their mountains. (As) with a bridle I controlled the lands Katmuḫu, Buššu, Alzu, Madanu, Niḫanu, Alaia, Tepurzu, Purulumzu, (and) the entire land of the extensive Šubaru. I subdued at my feet the kings, their leaders, and imposed (upon them) corvée. With my surpassingly strong might I frequently traversed mighty mountains (and) extremely difficult ranges, the paths of which no other king knew. I cut into their mountains with copper picks (and) widened their impassable paths. I did battle with forty kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought about the defeat of their army. (Thus) I became lord of all their lands. I fastened bronze clasps to the necks of those same kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought them to Ekur, the great mountain, the temple of my support, into the presence of the god Aššur, my lord. I made them swear by the great gods of heaven (and) underworld (and) levied upon them tribute and impost forever.

O protege of Mullissu,

Now, however, afraid that it might turn into my fault, I have decided to write to the king, my lord.
; he is useful to the king, my lord.
To the king of the lands, my lord: your servant Bel-ušezib. May Bel, Nabû and Šamaš bless the king, my lord!
Bel has said: "Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, is (seated) on the throne like Marduk-šapik-zeri, and (while) he is seated there, I will deliver all the countries into his hands." The king is the lord of 
I speak to ... , but nobody listens to me.
Heaven and earth tremble at the name of the king, my lord; may the lord of kings not forsake me! May my people not die in the moneylender's house!
old age
, be it a prefect 
Let the lord of kings ask the chief eunuch, and let the king hear the whole story.
Why am I dying for lack of means and of cold? Five days ago the king said, "Give Naṣiru a house," but nobody has given a house to me.
You are (a) just (king). Thanks to the just policy that you have adopted, Šamaš and Marduk have delivered (all the lands) from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea to the king, my lord.
As the king last year summoned his scholars, he did not summon me with them, (so) I wrote to the palace: "The apprentices whom the king appointed in my charge have learned Enūma Anu Enlil; what is my fault that the king has not summoned me with his scholars?"
The king, my lord, has reared me from my childhood until the present day, and ten times has the king, my lord, taken my hand and saved my life from my enemies.
Why is Aššur-natkil, the cohort commander of Adin, on his own hook dissolving a contract that the king, my lord, has made?
Also extract the words which the gods

the lord of kings 
... very ... to the king.
To the king, my lord: your servant Urad-Nanaya. The very best of health to the king, my lord! May Ninurta and Gula give happiness and physical well-being to the king, my lord!
Aššur and the great gods bound and handed over to the king these criminals who plotted against (king's) goodness and who, having concluded the king's treaty together with his servants before Aššur and the great gods, broke the treaty. The goodness of the king caught them up.
The king, my lord, is one who fears the gods. Aššur, Šamaš, Bel and Nabû, who have given you confidence, will not abandon the king and the crown prince, but will secure the rule of the king and the crown prince until far-off days.
The ... s of ... and Uruk are not doing the work and not glazing the bricks ...

The king, my lord, would perhaps say: "Why did you not remind (me)?" 
You, O Šamaš, 
Because I have been taking care of him, it is not good to go today. I shall go tomorrow, see them and report their health to the king. I will appoint exorcists to treat them.
A good reign — righteous days, years of justice; copious rains, huge floods, a fine rate of exchange! The gods are appeased, there is much fear of god, the temples abound; the great gods of heaven and earth have become exalted in the time of the king, my lord.
A maid of the king has written to me from the palace: "Urad-Gula has said: 'Get me the girl Ṣuhru, I will dedicate (her) to the palace.' Send (word) whether he should bring (her) to you or to me."
The ritual is on the evening of the 11th day.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi:
Also tomorrow, after the king has gone out, they should bury them in front of the main room and the bedrooms, in places to be additionally specified by the king. Daytime or nighttime makes no difference; one may bury whenever one likes.

Tomorrow evening there will be a (cultic) bath in the city of Tarbiṣu, and sacrifices of the king will be performed. Shall I go? 
He should ... have asked me!
Concerning the adding of the intercalary month about which the  king wrote to me, this is (indeed) a leap year. After Jupiter has become  visible, I shall write (again) to the king, my lord. I am waiting for  it; it will take this whole month. Then we shall see how it is and when we have to add the intercalary month.
The gods saw each other on the 13th day.
The crown prince is doing very well. The treatment which we carried out and gave to the chest lasted for 1 1/2 hours; he retained consciousness and afterwards sat up (in his bed). How proper he is!

Concerning the watch of the sun about which the king, my lord,  wrote to me, does the king, my lord, not know that it is being closely  observed? The day of tomorrow is the only (day left); once the watch  is over, (this eclipse), too, will have passed by, it will not occur.
If a falcon or a raven drops something it carries into the house  of a man, (or) according to a variant, before a man, the said house will  have išdihu. Išdihu (means) profit.
Concerning the crown prince about whom the king, my lord, wrote  to me: "I have been told that he should not go outdoors on the 1st  day" — this applies (rather) to the 2nd day.
Concerning the 1st and the 4th days about which the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Which one is favourable?" — both are  favourable. We call the 4th day a 'new day.' A new day has the same  qualities as the beginning of a month; it is favourable.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "I have gathered you,  your nephews and your cousins, you belong (now) to my entourage" — may Aššur together with his family, Bel and Nabû together with their  families, and the great gods of heaven and earth together with their families in the same way gather the name and seed, offspring, descendants and progeny of the king, my lord, and let them stay in their entourage! As long as heaven and earth exist, may they be commanders of the whole world! How fine, how good, how choice, how  correct, how full of love is what the king, my lord, has done!
Yesterday I performed the ritual of Bīt rimki. I made a burnt-offering and we executed a purification ritual.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-nadin-šumi. Good health  to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk greatly bless the king, my  lord!
The father of the king, my lord, gave me 10 homers of cultivated  land in Halahhu. For 14 years I had the usufruct of the land, and nobody disputed it with me. (But) now the governor of Barhalzi has come and mistreated the farmer, plundered his house and appropriated my land.
I, (nothing but) a dog, blessing the king, his lord, have blessed the king, my lord (with) these blessings. May the gods whose names I have invoked, accept and hear them, and grant these blessings to the king, my lord, a thousandfold!
Bel and Nabû and all the gods have lengthened the days of the king, my lord; still, during the (validity) period of the eclipse and the approach of the gods he may not go into open country.
We have begun to perform the rites of the month Elul (VI): "On the 16th you set a table made of tamarisk wood before Sin. At the head of the bed you place a censer of juniper for (the dream god) Zaqiqu. You wash his hands and feet with siderites and cassia. You bind lumps of salt, cassia, juniper, and lumps (taken) from the outer door to the hem of his garment."
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû-naṣir. May Nabû and Marduk

... has entered... a thousand times.
To the king, my lord: your servant Nabû'a. May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!

To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord! May the great gods bestow long days, well-being and joy upon the king, my lord!
Nevertheless, the king, my lord, should be on his guard and under strong protection. Apotropaic rituals, penitential psalms and rites against malaria and pestilence should be performed for the life of the king, my lord, and of my lords the princes.
As to what the king, my lord, wrote to me: "Is it good for Aššur-mukin-paleya to come up into my presence, and Sin-per'u-ukin to come up with him? Can the latter join him? They are (now) separated" —
To the great crown prince, the son of the king of the whole world, my lord: your servant Adad-šumu-uṣur. Good health to the son of the king of all lands! May Aššur, Sin, Šamaš, Nabû and Marduk, and the great gods of heaven and earth very greatly bless the son of the king of all lands, my lord.
Nobody has reminded (the king) about Urad-Gula, the servant of the king, my lord. He is dying of a broken heart, and is shattered (from) falling out of the hands of the king, my lord. The king, my lord, has  revived many people.
To the king, my lord: your servant Marduk-šakin-šumi. Good  health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king,  my lord!
May Mullissu bestow 
And concerning the rains which were so scanty this year that no  harvest was reaped, this a good omen pertaining to the life and vigour of the king, my lord. Perhaps the king, my lord, will say: "Where did you see (that)? Tell me!" In a report sent by Ea-mušallim to his lord Marduk-nadin-ahhe it is written:
The king should not be afraid of this eclipse! The planets Jupiter, Venus and Saturn were present during the eclipse.
We ourselves have kept watch (but) we have not observed it... One day it might be too early, another day it might lie flat (in the  horizon). To see it, our eyes should (literally) have fallen on  it.
To the king, my lord: your servant Mar-Issar. Good health to the king, my lord! May Nabû and Marduk bless the king, my lord!
We kept the watch; on the 14th day the moon and the sun saw each other.
