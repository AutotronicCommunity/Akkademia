      "text": "When news of his father's murder reached Esarhaddon (Akk.  Aššur-aḫu-iddina  \"The god Aššur has given a brother\") in his place of refuge in the land Ḫanigalbat, Sennacherib's chosen successor mustered his supporters and quickly marched east, towards the Assyrian capital. En route, he met the armed forces of his rebel brothers, but those troops quickly changed sides. Before his arrival at Nineveh, his father's murderer(s) had already fled (probably to the land Urarṭu and then to the land Šubria).    During his twelve years as king, Esarhaddon was active both on and off the battlefield. In Babylonia, he defeated the insubmissive Gambulu and Bīt-Dakkūri tribes and a recalcitrant governor of the Sealand. He also sponsored major building projects at Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, Sippar, and Uruk. Esarhaddon's public works in southern Mesopotamia sought to bolster good relations between Assyria and Babylonia; that was not an easy task, as Sennacherib's Babylonian policies left many Babylonians with a feeling of resentment towards Assyria. Further south, along the west coast of the Persian Gulf, the Assyrian army marched deep into the desert, conquered the land Bāzu, and defeated eight local rulers. To the east and northeast, Esarhaddon fought with the land Elam, Median rulers, and the Manneans. Esarhaddon also states that he killed a few Cimmerian and Scythian rulers. To the northwest, the Assyrian army invaded the land Šubria. The objective was likely to capture or kill the fugitive brother(s) of his who had taken refuge there. After the Šubrian king refused Esarhaddon's extradition request, the Assyrian army besieged and conquered the heavily fortified city Uppume and eliminated any potential threat to his own succession plan. Shortly thereafter, in 672 BC, a grand assembly was convened to declare Ashurbanipal heir to the throne of Assyria and Šamaš-šumu-ukīn as heir to that of Babylonia. The royal family, the nobles and inhabitants of Assyria, and vassal rulers swore oaths to uphold Esarhaddon's succession plan.    To the west, Esarhaddon marched to the Levantine coast and into the Arabian desert. He also invaded Egypt. At Sidon, he put down a rebellion, captured and executed its chief conspirator Abdi-Milkūti, and reorganized the city as an Assyrian center. Sidon's Cilician ally Sanda-uarri was also captured and beheaded. At Nineveh, the severed heads of those two rulers were hung around the necks of their nobles and paraded through the city's squares while people chanted \"In Tašrītu (VII) - the head of Abdi-Milkūti! In Addaru (XII) - the head of Sanda-uarri!\" In the Arabian peninsula, Esarhaddon put down a rebellion incited against a ruler loyal to Assyrian interests. The Assyrian army marched to Egypt three times. The first expedition failed miserably, but the second was successful, as Egyptian forces were thrice defeated, the city Memphis captured, and the pharaoh Taharqa driven into exile. On his third trip, in 669 BC, Esarhaddon died en route to Egypt. As had been carefully planned, Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukīn ascended their respective thrones, the former in 669 BC and the latter in 668 BC.     Further reading    A.

      "text": "The present series of publications, Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP), is intended to present up-to-date editions of the royal inscriptions of a number of Neo-Assyrian rulers.  It is modeled on the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) series and will carry on where its RIMA (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods) publications ended.  The RIM Project was initiated by A. Kirk Grayson at the University of Toronto in 1979 and over the years received extensive support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and private individuals, in particular Dr. Lawrence Shiff.  In all, it produced ten volumes in its various sub-series. Dr. Grayson retired from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a few years later found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits due to personal and family illnesses. At that time, he handed over responsibility for the work of the project to me, formerly the assistant director and at times acting director of the RIM Project. When I took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and when the last RIM volume (RIME 1 by Dr. Douglas R. Frayne) appeared in early 2008, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist. Work on several further volumes of inscriptions of Assyrian and Babylonian rulers had already begun during the time of the RIM Project and Dr. Grayson passed on responsibility for the materials and manuscripts to myself, and thus in 2007 I initiated the current project in order to continue the task of making the official inscriptions of the several important Neo-Assyrian rulers available in up-to-date, scholarly editions. While the volumes in the new series will resemble the format of the RIM volumes in most matters, the RINAP volumes will include indices of proper names and a selection of photographs; moreover, editions of the texts will also be available online, in connection with the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc).     This book, the first volume to appear, is number 4 in the RINAP series since it will be preceded by a volume of the inscriptions of Sargon II (currently being prepared by myself, with the collaboration of Dr. Andreas Fuchs for two texts), a volume of the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V (begun by Dr. Hayim Tadmor and being completed by his collaborator Dr. Shigeo Yamada), and a volume of the inscriptions of Sennacherib (begun by Dr. Grayson and being finished by RINAP staff, in particular Dr. Jamie Novotny and Dr. Matthew Rutz). Dr. Jamie Novotny and Dr. Greta Van Buylaere are currently carrying out work on the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal and his successors.     The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the RINAP Project research grants in 2008 and in 2010 to help carry out its work and my thanks must be expressed to it. My appreciation must also be extended to the University of Pennsylvania, where the project is based in the Babylonian Section of its Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

      "text": "In 1987, at the Rencontre Assyriologique in Istanbul, my good friend and colleague, Kirk Grayson, who was at that time the director of the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project in Toronto, asked me if I would be willing to undertake the editing of Esarhaddon’s royal inscriptions. I agreed to do so with the understanding that I had numerous obligations at the University of Pennsylvania and that I would be able to work only sporadically on the volume. I had no idea that the preparation of this book would take so long. By the time the first draft of the manuscript was completed, the RIM Project was in difficulty due to severe funding problems. The corpus of Esarhaddon’s inscriptions was thrown into limbo, but was rescued by Grant Frame, who revived the project in Philadelphia when he was awarded funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities; thus, my work became the inaugural volume of the rebranded RIM Project, the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period Project (RINAP).    In the course of the preparation of this volume, numerous individuals and institutions have aided me; I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to all of them.    Work on the present corpus of texts necessitated extensive travel for collation of previously published inscriptions and for examination of unpublished material. Thanks must be expressed to the various museums and museum authorities who have allowed me to collate documents in their collections, provided me with information, and facilitated me in my research. In particular, the directors, keepers, curators, and assistants of the Aleppo Museum (Aleppo), Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), Harvard Semitic Museum (Cambridge, Massachusetts), Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Chicago), Musée d’Art et d’Histoire (Geneva), Archaeological Museums (Istanbul), Fr. Schiller Universität (Jena), British Museum (London), Yale Babylonian Collection (New Haven), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Musée du Louvre (Paris), University Museum (Philadelphia), Wiener Museum für Völkerkunde (Vienna), and the Universität Zürich (Zürich). There were too many individuals at all of these institutions that went out of their way to make my research easier and to help me enjoy their collections and their cities for me to mention individually, but I am deeply grateful for their wonderful hospitality and help in my research. In addition, I would like to thank the Trustees of the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Vorderasiatisches Museum, and the University Museum for allowing me to publish photographs of objects bearing Esarhaddon inscriptions, and the University of Toronto Press for allowing me to include text nos. 118–129, 131–139, and 1010, which are taken from Frame, RIMB 2, with only minor updating/changes.    Numerous individuals aided in the production of this volume in some way. Since the preparation of this book has spanned two decades, it is impossible for me to name everyone who has provided information on particular pieces or contributed in some other way. I hope I will be forgiven if I have inadvertently left anyone out. In Toronto, when the volume was under the direction of Kirk Grayson (director of the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia Project), several individuals contributed to the technical preparation of the volume: Amy E. Barron, Katherine Glaser, Hope Grau, and Jamie Novotny. During the final stages of preparation, when the book was under the direction of Grant Frame (director and editor-in-chief of the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period Project) in Philadelphia, several postdoctoral researchers and student assistants helped in the completion of the volume: Joshua Jeffers, Andrew Knapp, Jamie Novotny, Matthew T. Rutz, Zackary Wainer, and William Zimmerle. Robert Ritner and Jennifer Houser Wegner provided an up-to-date translation of the Egyptian inscriptions that appear on VA Ass 2258 (text no. 71). Last, but by no means least, Steve Tinney undertook the arduous task of generating the final camera-ready copy and converting and preparing the texts for the online version. My deepest gratitude is offered to them.    The penultimate manuscript was read by Eckart Frahm, Israel Ephʿal, and Wilfred Lambert, all of whom made numerous astute comments, welcome criticisms, and improvements, particularly on the transliterations and translations. In addition to providing valuable feedback, Eckart Frahm kindly provided me with unpublished editions, copies, and photographs of select sources for text no. 1 (exs. 32–33), text no. 57 (exs. 6 and 9), text no. 58 (ex. 3), and VA 7505 and its duplicate VA 15465 (text no. 1006) prior to publication by him. Members of the editorial board and the project consultants offered helpful suggestions at various times near the completion of the volume. Their time, care, and generosity are greatly appreciated.    Finally, my appreciation must go to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and several private individuals, in particular Dr. Lawrence Shiff, whose financial support paid for my travel to the numerous museums cited above, with the exception of my trip to Syria, which was paid by the University Museum and its then-director Robert Dyson. The preparation of this volume has been very educational and a great deal of fun. I am deeply grateful to Kirk Grayson, to whom this volume is dedicated, for involving me in his project and funding my travel, to Robert Dyson who funded my only trip to the Near East, and to Grant Frame who rescued my work from oblivion.

      "text": "The volumes in the RINAP series are modeled upon the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM), with a few modifications, in particular the addition of indices of proper names and a few photographs. Like the RIM volumes, the volumes in this series are not intended to provide analytical or synthetic studies, but rather to provide basic text editions that can serve as the foundations for such studies. Thus, extensive discussions of the contents of the texts are not presented, and the core of each volume is the edition of the relevant texts.    In this volume, the order of the texts is based for the most part upon the following two criteria:     (1) The city at which the structure dealt with in the building or dedicatory portion of the text was located. If that information is not preserved in what is preserved of the text, the provenance of the inscribed object is the determining factor.    (2) The type of object upon which the inscription is written (prism, cylinder, tablet, etc.).     The system of numbering the text throughout the series is more straightforward than that of the RIM series, as the numbering comprises only the name of the ruler and the text number; for example, RINAP 4 text no. 1 is “Esarhaddon 1.” Should one be inclined, one could apply the RIM system of numbering inscriptions in its Assyrian Periods sub-series. Therefore, RINAP 4 text no. 1 could be referred to as “A.0.112.1,” which is to be interpreted as follows: A = Assyrian Periods; 0 = Inapplicable Dynasty; 112 = Esarhaddon; and 1 = Text 1.     Following the practice of the RIM series, inscriptions that cannot be assigned definitely to a particular ruler are given text numbers beginning at 1001. Certain other inscriptions that provide information relevant for establishing royal names and titles (e.g. “servant seals”) and any composed in the name of another member of the royal family (e.g., royal wives) have been given numbers that begin at 2001.     In the volumes of the RINAP series, the term “exemplar” is employed to designate a single inscription found on one object. The term “text” is employed to refer to an inscription that existed in antiquity and that may be represented by a number of more or less duplicate exemplars. In these editions exemplars of one text are edited together as a “master text,” with a single transliteration and translation. Variants to the “master text” are provided either on page (major variants) or at the back of the volume (minor variants).     Each text edition is normally supplied with a brief introduction containing general information. This is followed by a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars. This includes museum and excavation numbers (the symbol + is added between fragments that belong to the same object), provenance, dimensions of the object, lines preserved, and indication of whether or not the inscription has been collated (c = collated with the original, p = collated by means of a photograph, (p) = partially collated from a photograph; and n = not collated). The next section is normally a commentary containing further technical information and notes. The bibliography then follows. Items are arranged chronologically, earliest to latest, with notes in parentheses after each item. These notes indicate the exemplars with which the item is concerned and the nature of the publication, using the following key words: provenance, photo, copy, edition, translation, catalogue, and study. Certain standard reference works (e.g., the various volumes of “Keilschriftbibliographie” and “Register Assyriologie” published in Orientalia and Archiv für Orientforschung respectively; Borger, HKL 1–3; AHw; CAD; and Seux, ERAS) are not normally cited, although they were essential in the collecting and editing of these texts. While the bibliographies should contain all major relevant items, they are not necessarily exhaustive; a vast amount of scattered literature exists on many of the inscriptions edited in this volume and much of this literature is of only limited historical interest.     As noted earlier, a distinction is made between major and minor variants to a “master text”; the major variants are placed at the bottom of the page and the minor variants at the back of the book. In brief, major variants are essentially non-orthographic in nature, while minor variants are orthographic variations. Orthographic variants of proper names may at times be significant and thus on occasion these will also appear on the page as major variants. Complete transliterations of all exemplars in the style of musical scores are found on the CD-ROMs accompanying the volumes and thus any reader who finds the notes on variants insufficient for his/her needs may check the full reading of any exemplar. Such scores, however, are not normally given for bricks and seal inscriptions.     Most of the inscriptions are written in Neo-Assyrian script; a few texts are written in contemporary Babylonian script, archaizing Neo-Babylonian script, or using a mixture of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sign forms. Unless otherwise indicated, the script of a given text is Neo-Assyrian.     Nineteen photographs are included in this volume. The selection ranges from several inscriptions which have no previously published photograph or hand-drawn facsimile, including several pieces housed in the  University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, to a few well photographed objects, including Lord Aberdeen’s Black Stone. The photographs are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to show a few of the object types upon which Esarhaddon’s inscriptions were written.     As is the normal practice for transliterating cuneiform inscriptions, lower case Roman is used for Sumerian and lower case italics for Akkadian; logograms in Akkadian texts appear in capitals. The system of sign values in Borger, Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon, is generally followed. Italics in the English translation indicate either an uncertain translation or a word in the original language.     There are several differences between the RIM and RINAP styles. Among these, the most notable is that all partially preserved or damaged signs, regardless of how they are broken, now appear between half brackets (⌜ and ⌝). Thus, no partially preserved sign has square brackets ([ and ]) inserted in its transliteration; for example, [DINGI]R and LUGA[L KU]R appear in the transliteration as ˹DINGIR˺ and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ respectively. This change was made to ensure compatibility of the online RINAP editions with the standards of the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), the parent site and project where RINAP online is housed. This change was implemented in the print version in order to present identical editions in RINAP 4 and RINAP online. Note, however, that the translations may appear more damaged than their corresponding transliterations indicate, as the translations were prepared according to standard Assyriological practices; for example, ˹DINGIR˺ (= [DINGI]R) and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ (= LUGA[L KU]R) are translated as “[the go]d” and “king [of the lan]d,” and not “the god” and “king of the land.”     In addition to the indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications found in RIM volumes, the RINAP volumes also contain indices of proper names (Personal Names; Geographic, Ethnic, and Tribal Names; Divine, Planet, and Star Names; Gate, Palace, Temple, and Wall Names; and Object Names). Online versions of the manuscripts are maintained by Oracc and are fully searchable; moreover, the Oracc transliterations will be automatically supplied to the CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative)  repository.

      "text": "Esarhaddon is one of the best attested ancient Assyrian kings; a large and diverse corpus of his own inscriptions and numerous other cuneiform documents, as well as the Old Testament (Ezra 4:2) and a few classical sources, provide evidence on his reign. He was the third king of the Sargonid dynasty (721–612 BC), the last ruling family of the Assyrian empire. There is a substantial body of circumstantial evidence which leads me to believe that the Sargonid kings were ethnic Arameans and their tribal homelands were in or near the city of Ḫarrān in northwestern Mesopotamia. [1]  The founder of the dynasty, Sargon II, was a military man and it is generally assumed that he was a usurper since his name means “the king is legitimate,” [2]  although in one inscription on a glazed wall plaque he claims to be the son of Tiglath-pileser III; he gives us no genealogy in his other inscriptions. This would make him the brother or half-brother of his immediate predecessor, Shalmaneser V. If the common assumption that he was a usurper is correct, then Sargon had not been designated as successor by Shalmaneser V, but had seized the throne from him or upon his death. The wall plaque inscription could have been a true genealogic statement or an attempt to legitimize his rule. Sargon and his successors, while possibly ethnic Arameans, nevertheless assumed the legacy of their predecessors, the Assyrians. They conducted their business in Akkadian, the language of the Assyrians, took Akkadian throne names, and ruled from the old Assyrian capitals of Aššur (modern Qalʿat Šarqāt) and Kalḫu (modern Nimrud, biblical Calah), and then later from Dūr-Šarrukīn (modern Khorsabad) and Nineveh. They also adopted Assyrian religion, culture and history as their own and proclaimed themselves as the rightful successors and heirs of the ancient Assyrians and their imperial legacy.    Sargon II (721–705 BC), Esarhaddon’s grandfather, was killed in battle in 705 BC, likely against the Cimmerians in Anatolia. His body was never recovered and this left a nagging feeling of guilt in his successors that manifested itself in a composition generally titled “The Sin of Sargon.” This text was probably composed during the reign of Esarhaddon, but it is not included here as it is not really a royal inscription. It has been treated fully by H. Tadmor, B. Landsberger and S. Parpola in SAAB 3 (1989) pp. 3–51, and appears in Livingstone, SAA 3 as text no. 33. Sargon II was succeeded by his adult son Sennacherib (704–681 BC).      Sennacherib (“The god Sîn has replaced the brothers”) inherited several problems from his father, the worst of which was the fact that many Babylonians conspired with the Elamites to destabilize Assyrian control of southern Mesopotamia. Sennacherib tried several different approaches to pacify that area and bring it under his control, but nothing seemed to work. Eventually, in 700 BC, Sennacherib tried to solve the problem by installing Aššur-nādin-šumi (“The god Aššur is giver of a name”), his eldest son and designated successor, as king on the Babylonian throne. This solution worked for six years, but in 694 BC Sennacherib tried to stop Elamite meddling in Babylonia permanently by launching an amphibious invasion from the Persian Gulf. The Elamites counter-attacked by land and seized northern Babylonia. At that point some Babylonians captured Aššur-nādin-šumi and turned him over to the Elamites, who took him back to Elam and presumably executed him. Sennacherib took his revenge in 689 BC with a brutal attack on Babylon; he drove out the populace, destroyed the city and even cut watercourses through the devastated site to destroy any remnants of the city that he might have missed.    Possibly late in the reign of his father (Sargon), Sennacherib added another wife to his harem. Her name was Naqīʾa (“Pure”) in Aramaic and she appears in the ancient sources under that name or as Zakūtu, which is simply its Akkadian translation. Naqīʾa must have been an exceptional lady since she seems to have been extremely influential in palace politics during the reigns of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. It is safe to say that Sennacherib was deeply devoted to Naqīʾa and this devotion was not tempered when she presented him with a bundle of joy, his youngest son, whom they named Esarhaddon (“The god Aššur has given a brother”). It seems likely that this was the only son that Naqīʾa bore Sennacherib. I know virtually nothing about the raising of Esarhaddon and assume that Assyrian harems operated in the same, or in a similar, manner as in other societies. If so, then Esarhaddon spent his early years in the harem with his mother and lived with the men of his family after he reached sexual maturity. Esarhaddon may have been born with some sort of genetic disorder that left him frequently ill and in and out of remission. There has been a great deal of speculation as to the nature of his indisposition (see Frame, Babylonia p. 92) but the symptoms that we are given are ambiguous and a definite diagnosis certainly eludes us. Esarhaddon felt cursed by this disease and it probably was at least partially responsible for the treatise “The Sin of Sargon.” We are fortunate enough to get a glimpse into Esarhaddon’s personality through his letters, queries to the gods, omen reports and other types of non-royally commissioned texts that have survived. He suffered from anxiety and insecurity and he frequently pleaded with the gods to tell him what sins he had committed and why these things were being done to him. He was also a little paranoid because of the murder of his father and his shaky and frightening ascent to the throne. At least once while he was king he sensed an impending rebellion and reacted by purging his nobles.    The Sargonids had no strict laws of succession. Sitting monarchs designated successors, usually from among their sons, and named them as crown princes, installed them in the House of Succession with elaborate rituals, and exacted oaths from their cohorts to honor the selection after the monarch’s death.     In 689 BC after Esarhaddon’s eldest half-brother, Aššur-nādin-šumi, was taken from Babylon and likely executed by the Elamites, Esarhaddon was selected as crown prince and installed in the House of Succession. At that time, Esarhaddon was given a new name to fit his new position as crown prince: Aššur-etel-ilāni-mukīn-apli (“The god Aššur, prince of the gods, is the confirmer of an heir”). A few of Esarhaddon’s inscriptions use this name instead of Aššur-aḫu-iddina (texts nos. 13 and 74–75). Since Esarhaddon was the youngest of his half-brothers, his designation did not go down well with his siblings. By 681 BC familial discontent had reached the point that Esarhaddon was endangered and he felt it necessary to take refuge in the West, possibly with his mother’s relatives in or near Ḫarrān. This self-imposed exile created either a sense of futility and panic in his brothers, or an opportunity for them to act, and they plotted to seize the throne. On the twentieth day of the tenth month of 681 BC, Sennacherib was assassinated by one or more of his sons. One of the assassins was most likely Esarhaddon’s elder brother Urad-Mullissu, and Esarhaddon had to fight his way to the throne. He marched from his exile in the West through the bitter cold of the mountains until he met his brother’s army that had been sent to stop him, but just as with Napoleon on his return from Elba, the usurper’s army quickly went over to the side of Esarhaddon, who then marched with full strength on to Aššur. In the twelfth month of 681 BC Esarhaddon ascended the throne in Aššur.    Esarhaddon ruled from 680 until 669 BC. He was active militarily and as a builder of public works. With the exception of the texts on two partially preserved prisms (texts nos. 6 and 8) and a fragmentary clay tablet (text no. 34) from Nineveh, Esarhaddon’s royal inscriptions are not arranged chronologically so our order of events is based on information in Mesopotamian chronicles. In the South, Esarhaddon fought with Aramean tribes and the Elamites in two campaigns and he engaged himself in extensive building activity in Babylonia (see below for details). In the West, he conducted a campaign in Arabia and put down a rebellion in Sidon. He also claims to have received tribute from several kings of Cyprus. A second rebellion, this time in Tyre, may have prompted Esarhaddon to launch a successful invasion of Egypt in 671 BC, but he could not hold it and died in 669 BC, on his way to invade Egypt a second time. Esarhaddon also undertook the rebuilding of a temple in Ḫarrān, possibly in gratitude for his hospitable treatment while in exile. In the North, he fought the Cimmerians and, in his eighth year (673 BC), he invaded the land Šubria in order to capture or kill the brothers who had assassinated his father and had taken refuge there. Shortly after this successful campaign, which rid Esarhaddon of the last pretenders to his throne, he convened a grand assembly, declared his successors — Ashurbanipal (“The god Aššur is the creator of an heir”), a younger son, as king of Assyria, and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn (“The god Šamaš made firm the name”), his eldest son, as king of Babylonia — and made his family, people, and vassals swear oaths to uphold this succession plan. This elaborate ceremony was backed by writing a treaty with each vassal, thus confirming the designation of the pair’s succession. There is evidence that the two princes were Naqīʾa’s favorite grandsons. These treaties and others of Esarhaddon are not included in this volume as they are well treated in Parpola and Watanabe, SAA 2. In the East, Esarhaddon conducted another campaign against the Medes in eastern Iran.         Notes      1  See E.V. Leichty, “Esarhaddon’s Exile: Some Speculative History” in Studies Biggs pp. 189–191.       2  But note Frahm, Sanherib p. 2 for a different view of this matter."

      "text": "According to his inscriptions, Esarhaddon sponsored building activities not only in Assyria and Babylonia, but also in foreign lands conquered by him. Due to the fragmentary nature of some of the texts, the full extent of his accomplishments off the battlefield is not known. The present corpus mentions or records projects in Arbela, Aššur, Kalḫu, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu in Assyria, and in Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, and Uruk in Babylonia; this king also states that he rebuilt cities in the land Šubria that he had captured and destroyed when its king Ik-Teššup failed to comply with his requests.      Urban renewal and waterworks programs are mentioned for Babylon and Kalḫu; with regard to the former, its citizens were encouraged to resettle the city, build houses, plant orchards, and dig canals. The city walls and gates of Babylon were rebuilt and those of Kalḫu had their dilapidated sections renovated; Imgur-Enlil (Babylon’s inner wall) was built in exact accordance to its former plan and Nēmed-Enlil (Babylon’s outer wall) was lavishly decorated, making it a sight to be seen.      Royal residences and armories in the Assyrian cities of Baltil (Aššur), Kalḫu, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu were strengthened with large blocks of white limestone, enlarged, and lavishly decorated. Among these are “Fort Shalmaneser” in Kalḫu, the Nebi Yunus arsenal and the House of Succession in Nineveh, and Egaltura (“Small Palace”) in Tarbiṣu. Two, or possibly three, palaces were renovated and enlarged for the benefit of Ashurbanipal, Esarhaddon’s designated successor to the Assyrian throne. In connection with his enlargement of the Nebi Yunus arsenal, which he describes in great detail, Esarhaddon reports that twenty-two kings from the West supplied timber and stone, as well as transported building materials and stone colossi to Nineveh.      The restoration of various Assyrian and Babylonian temples and shrines is the subject of numerous texts; many epithets of the king declare accomplishments related to these activities. In Babylonia, Esarhaddon worked on Esagil (the temple of Marduk), this temple’s shrines and cellas, the ziqqurat Etemenanki, the processional avenue, and the  ḫarû -temple of Nabû in Babylon; Ezida (the temple of Nabû) and the temple of the goddess Gula in Borsippa; Ebaradurgara (the temple of Queen-of-Nippur) and Ekur (the temple of Enlil) in Nippur; and Eanna (the temple of Ištar) and its cellas Enirgalana and Eḫiliana in Uruk. Closer to home, in Assyria, he sponsored work on Egašankalama (the temple of Ištar) in Arbela and the neighboring  akītu -house in the town of Milqia; Ešarra (the temple of Aššur) in Aššur; and Emašmaš (the temple of Mullissu/Ištar), Ezida (the temple of Nabû), and the temple of the gods Sîn and Šamaš in Nineveh. A fragment of a display text suggests that he also sponsored work in Ḫarrān."

      "text": "Esarhaddon has been a popular subject of study from the very beginning of Assyriology. There are numerous books, dissertations and articles devoted to him, his inscriptions and his reign. The first book on Esarhaddon was published by E.A.W. Budge and contained an edition of the then-known royal inscriptions (Budge, History of Esarhaddon, 1880); the only texts edited were the Esarhaddon texts published in 1 R and 3 R, volumes that did not always clearly indicate the sources used. This was followed by the dissertation of R.F. Harper (University of Leipzig, 1888) which treated two inscriptions of Esarhaddon labeled cylinders A (text no. 2 ex. 2) and C (text no. 3). In 1914, V. Scheil published a small monograph containing an edition of a prism of Esarhaddon (text no. 1 ex. 5) and several inscriptions of other Sargonid kings (Scheil, Prisme). Another dissertation on Esarhaddon was completed by H. Hirschberg at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität of Berlin in 1931 (Hirschberg, Studien zur Geschichte Esarhaddons). In 1956, R. Borger produced a text edition of Esarhaddon’s inscriptions entitled Die Inschriften Asarhaddons, Königs von Assyrien that was comprehensive for its time and this excellent work has served the field of Assyriology well for more than half a century. Esarhaddon’s important vassal treaties have been published by D.J. Wiseman (Treaties, 1958), K. Watanabe (Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 3, 1987), and then S. Parpola and K. Watanabe (SAA 2, 1988). Most recently, in 1993, B.N. Porter attempted an in-depth study of Esarhaddon’s reign in her book Images, Power, and Politics. In addition to the books and dissertations written about Esarhaddon, there have been dozens of articles published that deal with newly found fragments of his inscriptions, interesting facets of his reign, his military exploits or his building activities. The bibliographies in this volume contain references to many of these articles. Treatments of Esarhaddon and his reign are to be found in every general history of Assyria or Mesopotamia. Particularly useful are the biographical sketch by A.K. Grayson in CAH 2  3/2 and the entry on Esarhaddon by B.N. Porter and K. Radner in PNA 1/1 pp. 145–152 sub Aššur-aḫu-iddina 7."

      "text": "Texts edited in this volume occasionally mention contemporary dates and the charts in this section are intended to aid the reader in understanding those dates.     The Mesopotamian month names and their modern equivalents are:         I    Nisannu   March–April   VII    Tašrītu   September–October       II    Ayyāru   April–May   VIII    Araḫsamna   October–November       III    Simānu   May–June   IX    Kislīmu   November–December       IV    Duʾūzu   June–July   X    Ṭebētu, Kinūnu   December–January       V    Abu   July–August   XI    Šabāṭu   January–February       VI    Ulūlu   August–September   XII    Addaru   February–March       VI₂    Intercalary Ulūlu     XII₂    Intercalary Addaru        Unless it is stated otherwise, the dates given in this volume (excluding those in bibliographical citations) are all BC. Each ancient Mesopotamian year has been given a single Julian year equivalent even though the ancient year actually encompassed parts of two Julian years, with the ancient year beginning around the time of the vernal equinox. For example, the fifth regnal year of Esarhaddon (the eponymy of Banbâ) is indicated to be 676, although it actually began around the middle of March in 676 and ended in early April 675 and thus events which took place late in the ancient year “676” actually took place early in the Julian year 675.  The table below, reprinted with permission from Parpola, LAS 2 p. 382, attempts to precisely convert Assyrian dates to Julian ones. Although the table is styled similarly to the conversions of Parker and Dubberstein (Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.–A.D. 75 [Providence 1956] pp. 25–47), there is one major difference: if the new moon is visible for the first time at 7 PM on the 3 rd  of March, then the chart tells you that the first day of the month is the 3 rd  of March, not the 4 th  of March, as indicated by Parker and Dubberstein’s charts. [3]  The dates are given as civil days, from midnight to midnight, and the dates (month/day) provided in the chart are those of the first day of each month. Based upon statements in contemporary texts and inference, Parpola (LAS 2 pp. 381–382) believes that in Assyria there were intercalary months in Sennacherib’s twenty-fourth regnal year (=Esarhaddon’s accession year) (VI 2 ) and in Esarhaddon’s third (VI 2 ), fifth (XII 2 ), eighth (XII 2 ), and eleventh (VI 2 ) regnal years; Parpola suggests also that these were leap years and these years are indicated in bold in the chart. [4]   In Babylonia there was an intercalary Addaru (XII 2 ) in Esarhaddon’s third regnal year.

Walker, who drew this matter to S. Parpola’s attention in a series of letters (September, 1984).       4  Parpola, SAA 10 no. 253:15–18 and no. 357:9–10 mention an intercalary Ulūlu (VI₂), which resulted in the postponement of the New Year’s Festival; Parpola dates both of these letters to Esarhaddon’s eleventh regnal year (670 BC)."

      "text": "In Assyria, each year was named after a high official, called a  limmu  or  līmu  in Akkadian, and lists of these officials (eponyms) were compiled by the Assyrian scribes. The following list of the eponym officials for the reign of Esarhaddon is based upon Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 51–52, 61, and 71. Dated inscriptions that are included in the present volume are also noted below; a number of inscriptions whose dates may possibly be determined with some degree of confidence (e.g., instances with a clear  terminus post quem  for the inscription) are given in bold.

Several exemplars of text no. 1 (Nineveh A) are dated according to the Elamite months “Opening of the Door” and Bēlet-ilī (probably pronounced Belili); at this time, I cannot offer a satisfactory explanation why Esarhaddon’s scribes dated copies of this text by Elamite names rather than Mesopotamian ones. With regard to the date of Tadmor’s  “Nineveh (Prism) S” (text nos. 5–9), see H. Tadmor (and E. Weissert), Studies Grayson pp. 273–276."

The standard edition of Mesopotamian chronicles is that of A.K. Grayson (Grayson, Chronicles), but note also the recent edition by J.-J. Glassner (Glassner, Chronicles) and the on-going work by I. Finkel and R.J. van der Spek (see  www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html  [http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html]  [2010]). For the convenience of the user of this volume, it has been thought useful to present translations of the relevant passages here; these translations are adapted from the aforementioned works.       1.   Chronicle Concerning the Period from Nabû-nāṣir to Šamaš-šuma-ukīn    (Grayson, Chronicles pp. 60–87 no. 1; Glassner, Chronicles pp. 193–203 no. 16 and pp. 202–207 no. 17; note also Brinkman, Studies Moran pp. 73–104)        iii 34–38)     On the twentieth day of the month Ṭebētu (X), Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was killed by his son in a rebellion.

The text introductions to the known one hundred and forty-three texts of Esarhaddon, the thirty inscriptions whose attribution to this Assyrian king is not entirely certain, and the ten inscriptions ascribed to his wife Ešarra-ḫammat, and to his mother Naqīʾa (Zakūtu), are sub-divided into ten main pages. The larger groups of texts--for example, those from Nineveh, Aššur, and Babylon--are further sub-divided for easier navigation of the contents. Those pages are accessible once you click on the main page link; for example, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5 pages of the Nineveh inscriptions will display when one clicks on the main ”Nineveh” link to the left.

The master text is ex. 1, with occasional minor restorations from the other exemplars. In earlier literature, exs. 2, 3, and 4 are referred to as Prism B, Prism S, and Prism SS respectively. Several of the exemplars from Aššur are known from Aššur excavation photographs: ex. 11 is photographed in Ass ph 4052, ex. 32 in Ass ph 6372, and ex. 33 in Ass ph 5884.   Ex. 33 was not available for study and therefore has not been incorporated into the score.   K. Radner (personal communication) has recently identified a prism fragment in the Sulaimaniya Museum (SM 410) as an exemplar of one of Esarhaddon’s Nineveh prism inscriptions (text nos. 1–3, 5–6, and 8); although the piece is reported to have come from Tell Shemshara, it probably originates from Nineveh. The inscription, of which only parts of seventeen lines of col. vi are preserved, is very badly worn and the extant text contains a passage describing the celebration held in honor of the completion of the armory; line 16' duplicates text no. 1 vi 59–60, text no. 2 vi 34–35, and text no. 3 vi 13'–14'. This newly identified fragment is cited here with the kind permission of K. Radner, who will publish SM 410 in AfO 52.

Exs. 1–2 duplicate one another up to line 102, at which point the texts appear to deviate from one another. For this reason, exs. 1–2 are edited separately in the edition beginning with line 103 and only a score of lines 16–102 is provided on the CD-ROM. The line numbering in this edition differs from that of previous editions, including Borger’s: the text is given consecutive line numbers for the obverse and reverse (=lines 53–110/112) rather than separate line counts for the obverse and reverse. The edition is a conflation of exs. 1–2; the text generally follows ex. 1, but follows ex. 2 in line 50.    The current online version of text no. 48 differs from the 2011 print edition of RINAP 4 in a few places. These changes are based on further collations by J. Novotny; see SAAB 19 (2011-2012) pp. 29-86 passim and JCS 66 (2014) pp. 97-98 n. 26.

Around the body of the vessel is a hieroglyphic Egyptian inscription that probably dates to the reign of 23rd-Dynasty king Osorkon III (ca. mid-eighth century BC). Takelot III, Osorkon’s son and immediate successor, appears to have dedicated the inscribed vessel while he was still a prince, as indicated by his titulary. The Egyptian text reads: “Returning from Bahiriya have I come, with all good grapes. O Foremost(?) savior of  ka -spirits, may you give them to the one who has any want or care [...] for the  ka -spirit of the prophet of Herishef, King of the Two Lands, the chief of Persekhemkheperre, the royal son of Ramses, the general and leader, Takelot, whose mother is Tentsa, the justified.” The first cartouche (on the right) is largely illegible and the second cartouche (on the left) reads: “Herishef, King of the Two Lands.” I thank Robert Ritner and Jennifer Houser Wegner for providing me with an up-to-date translation of the Egyptian text and cartouches.

According to an unpublished Nimrud catalogue, all of these pieces appear to have been found in secondary contexts in the Nabû temple in Kalḫu during the campaigns of 1955 (ND 4379a–d) and 1956 (ND 5404a–c).   Because the beginning of all of the Kalḫu cylinders is relatively uniform, the left half (ND 5404a + 4379b + 5404b) could be from a duplicate of text no. 77 (Kalḫu A) or text no. 78 (Kalḫu B) and not from the same cylinder as ND 4379a+. Wiseman (Iraq 26 p. 122) originally thought that ND 5404a–c were pieces of a duplicate of text no. 77. However, the text on ND 4379a+ diverges significantly from that of text no. 77. The first thirty-three lines duplicate text no. 77 (Kalḫu A) lines 1–35, text no. 78 (Kalḫu B) lines 1–33, and text no. 93 (Tarbiṣu A) lines 1–19. In addition, the end of the inscription shows some affinity with text no. 93 lines 25–40. Like text no. 77 and text no. 93, this cylinder is dated around the time Ashurbanipal was promoted to the position of heir designate of Assyria (672 BC).

Til Barsip is located on the Euphrates River near the modern border between Turkey and Syria. This text is commonly referred to as Esarhaddon’s Monument B (Mnm. B).    Access  Esarhaddon 97  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap4/Q003326/]    Source:    NMSA -  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P450498/]    Commentary   The obverse depicts Esarhaddon holding two prisoners with ropes. The kneeling, beardless Negroid figure wearing a  uraeus  headdress is generally identified as the crown prince of Egypt, Ušanaḫuru. The identity of the second figure, the bearded man wearing a conical hat, is not certain. Thureau-Dangin proposed that it was Abdi-Milkūti, king of Sidon, based on references to this ruler in Esarhaddon’s inscriptions, including line 25 of this text, and other scholars have identified this captive as Baʾalu, king of Tyre, since he supported Egypt and his city was besieged. The identification with Abdi-Milkūti is unlikely since this adversary of Esarhaddon was beheaded shortly after an unsuccessful escape attempt. As for the identification as Baʾalu, Ephʿal correctly notes that nowhere in Esarhaddon’s inscriptions is there any mention of this king’s capture or surrender after the siege of his city; this king, however, did continue to rule Tyre during the reign of Ashurbanipal. The identity of the standing, bearded prisoner remains open to debate. Compare Miglus, who suggests that there is no need to seek a direct link between the prisoners represented on the steles and specific military achievements recorded in Esarhaddon inscriptions, thus no need to identify the figures with known rulers. There are pictures of Ashurbanipal on one side of the stele and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn on the other.    The script is a mixture of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian signs, but Neo-Assyrian forms predominate. There is an uninscribed duplicate stele from Til Barsip that has been lined in preparation for an inscription. The steles measure 380×172×70 cm (inscribed stele) and 214×110×81 cm (duplicate stele). The steles were prepared very late in the reign, as pointed out by numerous scholars. The absence of an inscription on one stele and the fact that the inscribed stele was never completed may indicate that the pair of monuments was made not long before Esarhaddon’s death in 669 BC.

For the identification on the captive rulers, see the commentary of the previous text (text no. 97). There are symbols of eleven or twelve gods. One could argue that these represent the deities mentioned at the beginning of the inscription, however, there are only ten gods mentioned, one or two fewer than the symbols shown before the representation of Esarhaddon. The script is a mixture of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian signs, but Neo-Assyrian forms predominate.

The Zinçirli and Nahr el-Kelb inscriptions report Esarhaddon’s conquest of Egypt and his actions after the first battle there, while the Qaqun fragment describes an earlier stage of the military campaign, beginning with the departure from the city of Ashur, the attack on Baal, king of Tyre, who was an ally of Taharqa, and the advance to southern Palestine and farther to the Sinai Desert” (Ephʿal, JCS 57 [2005] p. 109). The text also “reports that the Assyrian army crossed the Sinai with the assistance of the people of Mibsam” (ibid. p. 109 n. 38). Cogan (Studies Ephʿal) has suggested that the fragment from Ben Shemen (text no. 1007) may originally have belonged to the same stele as the fragment from Qaqun.

The script of exs. 1 and 4 is Babylonian. Ex. 2 is written in an archaizing Neo-Babylonian script. In contrast, the script of exs. 3 and 5 is Neo-Assyrian. Ex. 1 is an octagonal prism and exs. 2–3 and 5 are all hexagonal prisms; ex. 4 is a small piece of a multi-column tablet.    AO 7736 once belonged to H. Pognon. Although no details about its original purchase have been published, it was probably acquired at or near Babylon. BM 78246 is part of the Budge 88-5-12 collection of the British Museum, objects that were purchased by E.A.W. Budge in 1888. At Babylon, Budge purchased “several large pieces of cylinders [= prisms] of Esarhaddon for a majîdî (dollar) each.” Note, however, that BM 78246 is registered as coming from Hillah.  J. Nougayrol (AfO 18 [1957–58] p. 314, with n. 1) recognized the join between AO 7736 and BM 78246; this join was not included in the print version of RINAP 4. MMA 86.11.278 was purchased from the Reverend William Hayes Ward by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) in 1886; the fragment was acquired when Ward led the Catharine Lorillard Wolfe Expedition to Babylonia in 1884–85. J. Novotny recently joined MMA 86.11.278 to AO 7736 (+) BM 78246 on the basis of script (same scribe), column divisions, and text lineation; details will be presented in a forthcoming article. The break down of the three fragments is as follows: (1) AO 7736 = i 3´–19´, iii 11´–16´, iv 1´–47´, v 1´–45´, and vi 11–45; (2) BM 78246 = i 1´–19´, ii 1´–22´, and iii 1´–16´; and (3) MMA 86.11.278 = i 1–14, ii 1–14, and vi 1–18. AO 7736+ (=RINAP 4 exs. 2, 6–7) preserves ca. 72% of the inscription and is presently the best preserved exemplar of Babylon E. Despite the joins between exs. 2, 6, and 7, the online edition still principally follows the edition published in RINAP 4. Note, however, that iii 34–56 are now iii 34–55 since the “blank” line (iii 34) of the print edition was removed since none of the known exemplars have a blank line in this part (or any part) of the inscription; and that vi 6-61 are now vi 5-60 since the assumed omitted line vi 5 was deleted since neither ex. 2 nor ex. 3 appear to have included that proposed scribal error. Furthermore, exs. 2 and 6–7 have been merged in the score (and bibliography); all three pieces are now regarded as ex. 2. In addition, a few, minor typographical errors in the edition have been corrected (see Novotny, SAAB 19 [2011-2012] pp. 29-86 passim).

Its script is Neo-Assyrian and it was thought to have been part of an eight-sided prism, with the piece coming from the top of three columns. As it turns out, BM 78247 belongs to the same prism as MMA 86.11.342 (+) CBS 1526, a large prism fragment in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) and a small fragment in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Philadelphia). The join of MMA 86.11.342 and CBS 1526 was proposed by M. Rutz and subsequently verified by the author; CBS 1526 is commonly referred to as Babylon (Prism) AC (Bab. AC). The joined New York and Philadelphia pieces were regarded as being an exemplar of Babylon A since the contents of col. i´ 13´–19´ deviated from Babylon C and, thus, that passage was regarded as filling in part of a gap then missing in Babylon A. BM 78247 col. iii´ 7–25 joins MMA 86.11.342+ col. i´ 1´–19´. The join was recognized by J. Novotny on the basis of the shape of the fragments, the script (Neo-Assyrian, with regular use of wide blank spaces between signs), and the width of the columns (narrow columns that accommodated only one or two words per line); see Novotny, JCS 67 (2015) pp. 164-168.     The three pieces preserve parts of the last six columns of a tall, solid ten-sided clay prism. Parts of 160 lines (31.25%) of the approximately 500 lines of text originally inscribed on the prism are extant. BM 78247 preserves col. i´ 1–3, col. ii´ 1–14, and col. iii´ 1–27. MMA 86.11.342 preserves col. iii´ 7–25, col. iv´ 1´–25´, col. v´ 1´–23´, and col. vi´ 1´–22´. CBS 1526 preserves col. iv´ 26´–43´, col. v´ 23´–42´, and col. vi´ 23´–32´. The restorations are generally based on text nos. 104 and 105. Assyrian hieroglyphs are stamped on the top (see text no. 115).

This undoubtedly refers to symbols that have been interpreted as a cryptographic royal inscription of Esarhaddon and that are found upon three clay prisms and one stone monument, all probably from Babylon. These symbols have been referred to as Assyrian hieroglyphs or astroglyphs, which may have been inspired by Assyrian encounters with Egyptian hieroglyphs. The texts that are found on the objects with the Assyrian hieroglyphic inscriptions are: text no. 104 ex. 1 (Babylon A), text no. 107 (Babylon F), text no. 111, and text no. 114 (Babylon D = Lord Aberdeen’s Black Stone). Inscriptions of this kind have so far only been identified for the kings Sargon II and Esarhaddon, and the cryptography did not follow Egyptian hieroglyphic writing directly but rather appears to have been inspired by the latter’s pictographic character. Although it is likely that these symbols represent Esarhaddon’s name and royal title(s), the matter of how to read the hieroglyphs, both individually and as a group, is still not settled.   While the interpretations offered below are extremely ingenious, I find them to be clever but dubious, as several of the readings are rather forced. I am, however, not able to offer a better solution. My misgivings are as follows:   1) The name.  Esarhaddon had at least three names, Aššur-aḫu-iddin, Aššur-etel-ilānī-mukīn-apli, and an Aramaic name that we do not know. While his throne name Aššur-aḫu-iddin is the most likely one to be on these monuments, it is not certain that this is the case.   2) The language.  We should probably expect the language to be Akkadian, but four instances on three exemplars are written counterclockwise. Aramaic is written right to left and hieroglyphic Egyptian is normally written from right to left but may be written in any direction. I do not know if this is meaningful.   3) Are the Assyrian hieroglyphs read syllabically or logographically? Akkadian could allow either or both.   4) All the solutions find themselves with too many hieroglyphs for the name alone and try to solve the problem by adding a pronoun or title after the name. This is where serious guesswork enters, and while I would not rule out any of these solutions, I remain unconvinced at this time.   The presentation which follows does not pretend to indicate the interpretations of the individual signs in a fully satisfactory manner and the reader must consult the original publications to understand the views and interpretations of the respective scholars.

All of these pieces may originate from Babylon. In ex. 1 the symbols are carved in relief in two registers atop the stone monument, and the consensus is that the symbols are to be read left to right. The order found on ex. 1 indicates the starting point in exs. 2–4, where the symbols were stamped in a counterclockwise circular pattern on one or both ends of each prism, apparently by at least two different stamps. Each hieroglyphic text has eight symbols in the same basic order, with one major variant and a few minor stylistic variants. In ex. 1 symbol 4 is a bull, while in exs. 2–4 symbol 4 is a lion. Note that a lion is incised facing the beginning of some of the royal inscriptions on stone vases from Aššur (e.g., text no. 72). In ex. 1 symbol 1 has a stylized tree decorating the base of the podium and the divine horns on the headdress are more pronounced than in exs. 2–4. In ex. 1 symbol 3 is a stylized tree, while in exs. 2–4 the tree is greatly simplified.   D. Nadali (Iraq 70 [2008] pp. 87–104) has tentatively ascribed to Esarhaddon the figural elements (bull’s leg, vegetation, man’s hand and bare head) on eight high-relief bricks, seven of which are known to have been excavated by R.C. Thompson in his first season of excavations at Nineveh (1927–28). These pieces are fragmentary, and, as Nadali notes, another possibility is that they came from the reign of Sargon II.

Access  Esarhaddon 118  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap4/Q003347/]    Source:    VA Bab 00647  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P450511/]  (BE 06403)    Commentary   The seal was found in a basket filled with various kinds of stones in room E of a Parthian building in Amran-ibn-Ali on April 18, 1900; see Wetzel, Spätzeit pl. 14 Dd8IV and pl. 15 for the location of the room. The two inscriptions are written in opposite directions on the seal; inscription A begins at the bottom of the seal, while inscription B begins at the top of the seal.   Watanabe (Bagh. Mitt. 16 [1985] pp. 390–391) has argued plausibly that inscription A may well be composed of two separate inscriptions. Since the god depicted on the seal is Adad, line 3 (“seal of the god Adad”) may have been the original inscription on the piece. At some later point, an engraver was ordered to add the phrase “Property of the god Marduk of Esagil.” He added “Property of the god Marduk” (line 1) and then began to put “of Esagil” immediately below it. However, after adding the first wedge (line 2) he realized that there was not quite enough room between line 1 and line 3 to put the new line. He thus put “of Esagil” (line 4) after the original inscription mentioning Adad. Still later, the inscription of Esarhaddon (inscription B) rededicating the piece to the god Marduk was added.

The inscription appears to commemorate work on the temple of the goddess Gula at Borsippa and to mention the king’s victorious campaign against the Chaldean tribe of Bīt-Dakkūri and its leader Šamaš-ibni. This text is commonly referred to as Borsippa A (Brs. A).

Since the inscription describes a project of restoration at Borsippa, it seems likely that the piece came from that city. The fragment is the right end of an apparently solid cylinder and measures 9.2×6.5×4.3 cm. If the cylinder was completely inscribed, portions of not quite half of the total number of lines are preserved. The inscription is written in contemporary Babylonian script.    The inscription was ascribed to Shalmaneser V by Luckenbill, but Meissner has shown that it must belong to Esarhaddon. The matter described in the historical section of the text appears to be the campaign directed against the Bīt-Dakkūri and their leader Šamaš-ibni, who had seized land belonging to the inhabitants of Babylon and Borsippa. On this action, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 79–81.    Inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar II refer to the temple(s) of the goddess Gula at Borsippa by several names: é-gu-la, é-ti-la, é-zi-ba-ti-la.

Gibson. Exs. 2–5 and 15 were collated from casts in the Oriental Institute, Chicago. The casts of exs. 2–5 are not always clear and sometimes show a little more or less at the edges and adjacent to breaks than do the copies made by Goetze. In the latter circumstances, the transliteration in the score follows the copies by Goetze. The present location of ex. 11 is not known. It is not impossible that exs. 14–15 should be taken as exemplars of text no. 129 rather than of this inscription.    The inscription is written in both contemporary Babylonian script (exs. 1–7 and 9–14) and contemporary Assyrian script (exs. 8 and 15). The master line is a conflation of the various exemplars, but mainly relies upon exs. 1 and 2.    A number of tiny fragments are stored with ex. 1 in the Oriental Institute. A few have traces of signs, but none were used in Goetze’s copy. The largest of these fragments joins the main piece and adds parts of lines 10–13. This fragment is included in the score for ex. 1, but the remaining fragments are not because it is not absolutely certain that they do indeed come from ex. 1 and because it is uncertain where some of them would fit in the score. One in particular, however, may have parts of lines 1–3:  Lacuna   1′ [...] x [...]   2′ [...  -a ] s-ḫa- [...  l ] i- ⸢ i ⸣-[...]   3′ [... GAŠA]N GA[L- ...]   Lacuna    A lengthy hymn to the goddess “Queen-of-Nippur” has been published by W.G. Lambert, Studies Kraus pp. 173–218. Her exact character and identification are not clear. Lambert describes her as a “form of Ištar” (ibid., p. 173) which would seem likely since many of the exemplars were found on the site of the earlier temple of Inanna. Level 1 of the Inanna temple has been identified as Esarhaddon’s restoration. For information on that level, see Zettler, Inanna Temple pp. 49–50.

Ex. 2 is part of the Frau Professor Hilprecht collection at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität (Jena) and thus likely comes from the work of H.V. Hilprecht at Nippur. Ex. 2 was collated by J. Oelsner. Ex. 3 was collated from a cast of the piece in the Oriental Institute, Chicago, with additional collations from a new cast and mold provided by J.A. Brinkman. Information on ex. 4 comes from the publication of J.A. Brinkman. Ex. 4 is broken immediately before its first line (our line 1). Thus it is not impossible that that was not the first line of the inscription and that this exemplar had a different inscription than the others. Exs. 1 and 2 cannot be parts of the same cylinder as has sometimes been suggested. It is possible that exs. 3 and 4 are parts of the same cylinder.   The inscription is written in contemporary Babylonian script on all exemplars. Line rulings frequently indicate that two of our lines might have been considered one line by the ancient scribes; however, since the beginnings of the lines are not preserved it is not possible to determine whether or not the “second halves” of these lines were indented.   The line arrangement follows ex. 4 for lines 1–22, ex. 1 for lines 23–31, ex. 2 for lines 32–37, and ex. 3 for lines 38–41. The master line is based upon ex. 4 for lines 5–20, ex. 1 for lines 21 and 23–25, ex. 2 for lines 32–35, and ex. 3 for lines 39–41. The remaining lines are a conflation of various exemplars. Restorations in lines 7–39 are based upon text no. 128 lines 4–20 and text no. 133 lines 8–40; where text no. 128 and text no. 133 diverge, preference is given to text no. 128. Restorations in lines 40–41 are based upon text no. 134 lines 24–25 and text no. 135 lines 24–25.

It was acquired by the British Museum in 1878, and its provenance is not known. A section of ex. 4 appears to have become detached from the main body of the cylinder in recent times. The piece was attached when the cylinder was studied by Stephens (YOS 9 no. 137), and he notes three variants in lines 8 and 41 that can no longer be confirmed. The score gives what is now preserved of the exemplar, but the additional variants are included in the notes, where they are attributed to Stephens. Ex. 5 is reported to be in Heidelberg, but it cannot be located at present. The first three lines and the last line preserved on this exemplar (lines 6–8 and 25 of the inscription) are not readable on the excavation photographs and are not included in the score. The inscription is written in contemporary Babylonian script.   The number of lines and line arrangement differ markedly among the various exemplars. The arrangement used for the master line follows that used by Borger, which goes back to the copies of ex. 1 made by Strong and Meissner-Rost. It should be noted, however, that these copies do not indicate indented lines and are inconsistent with regard to the manner in which they number them. The copy by Pinches indicates the indented lines and line rulings found on ex. 1. The master line follows ex. 1, with help from ex. 3 in lines 22, 30, 32, and 37.   A cast of an exemplar of this inscription with “a large number of variant readings” was once owned by the Haskell Museum, Chicago (Luckenbill, ARAB 2 p. 279 n. 1), but the piece cannot at present be located in the Oriental Institute. Borger saw an uncorrected carbon-copy of a manuscript of Luckenbill’s which gave the variants (without diacritics) for this piece and noted them in his edition of the inscription.

The stamped area on ex. 1 measures 16.2×8 cm. The excavation photographs are not always clear, and it is not possible to confirm the reading of many signs on exs. 1–3 from them. In particular, the inscription on ex. 2 is so faint as to be basically illegible on the photo. The edition is based upon the published edition of ex. 1 by J.

Schott (UVB 1 p. 57 n. 1 to no. 21) states that W. von Soden informed him of an additional piece with this inscription. It is not known to which piece he refers since he notes the same thing for the next text (our text no. 138).

The present location of the brick is not known, and the inscription is edited from the copy by Schott.   Schott proposed to read in line 3 only an uncertain  é-an-na  É before  d a-nù-u-ti ; however, a note in his work stated that according to von Soden a new exemplar of the inscription had “ ana balāṭi-šú ” before  é-an-na . Since the same comment is credited to von Soden for text no. 137, it is uncertain if he had actually found two bricks or one, and if only one, whether it had the inscription of text no. 137 or text no. 138.
