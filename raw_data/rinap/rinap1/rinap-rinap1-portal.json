      "text": "In 745 BC, during a revolt in the city Kalḫu that brought the reign of Aššur-nārārī V to an end, Tiglath-pileser III (Akk.  Tukultī-apil-Ešarra , \"My trust is in the heir of Ešarra\") ascended the throne of Assyria, restored order to the troubled kingdom, and set the Assyrian army in motion once again. Although he was a member of the royal family, Tiglath-pileser was not in line to become king. Sources about who his father was are contradictory; one text records that he was a son of Adad-nārārī III, while another states that he was a son of the previous king, Aššur-nārārī V. Nevertheless, he proved to be a very capable ruler. Under his authority, Assyria became a formidable military and political power, just as it had been in the days of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III.    During his eighteen years on the throne, Tiglath-pileser reshaped the political map of southwestern Asia by mounting an aggressive military campaign every year that he was king. His armies marched in all directions, beginning with the south, where he defeated the Arameans living in northern Babylonia, on the eastern bank of Tigris River. Tiglath-pileser then set his sights on rivals in the northwest and the west. He fought the rival kingdom of Urarṭu and its north Syrian allies; the Urarṭian army was routed and the troublesome Syrian city Arpad was conquered and annexed. With Urarṭu out of the way, Assyria was able to rapidly annex numerous Syro-Palestinian states, including Unqi (Pattinu), Aram-Damascus, and parts of the kingdom of Israel. Conquered territories were efficiently reorganized as Assyrian provinces and placed under the direct control of a trusted official ( ša rēši ) of the king. Tiglath-pileser also instituted unprecedented large-scale two-way deportations, a policy that transformed the demographic structure and cultural character of Assyria. Moreover, numerous Anatolian and Levantine rulers became vassals. At the time the west was being reorganized, the Assyrian army advanced northward, into the heart of Urarṭu and eastward into Median territory. In the east, rulers, weak and powerful alike, were brought into submission and their lands were transformed into Assyrian provinces.    Towards the end of his reign, Tiglath-pileser turned his attention to Babylonia and conquered it. He not only took the traditional title \"king of the lands of Sumer and Akkad,\" but also declared himself \"king of Babylon,\" something none of his predecessors had done. Tiglath-pileser ascended the throne as Babylon's legitimate king and participated in the akītu-festival by taking the hand of the god Bēl (Marduk), a role suitable only for the true and divinely sanctioned king of Babylon. Thus, both Assyria and Babylonia were under the authority of a single king, a situation that would create new geo-political complications, some of which would come to a head in the reigns of his successors.    When Tiglath-pileser III died in 727 BC, his son and designated successor, Shalmaneser (Akk.  Salmānu-ašarēd , \"The god Salmānu is pre-eminent\"), ascended the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia; he is also called Ulūlāyu — \"(One born in the month) Ulūlu\" in royal correspondence and Babylonian Kinglist A. He should have been well suited to performing his duties as king since he had held an important role in his father's administration and since he had presumably been educated as the heir designate. Shalmaneser followed in his father's footsteps, namely by conquering and annexing several foreign lands and cities. His achievements included the conquest of the city Samaria, the capital of Israel (although the nature of its conquest has long been disputed among scholars), and possibly those of Samʾal and Que, kingdoms in north Syria and southeast Anatolia. Babylonia, which he inherited from his father, remained firmly in his hands.    Although the details of his reign remain obscure, Shalmaneser appears to have successfully maintained the kingdom, at least for a few years. However, during his fifth regnal year (722 BC), his tenure as king was brought to an abrupt and violent end. Sargon II, Shalmaneser's brother and immediate successor, records some of the details of the internal strife that took place in Assyria at that time, but describes those events in a manner that shows him, and not Shalmaneser, as the \"legitimate king\" of Assyria. The Babylonian Chronicle states that Shalmaneser died, but does not record the disruption that shook Assyria's foundations.     Further reading    H.D. Baker, \"Salmanassar V.,\" pp. 585-587 in M.P.

      "text": "The present series of publications, Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP), is intended to present up-to-date editions of the royal inscriptions of a number of Neo-Assyrian rulers.  It is modeled on the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) series and carries on where its RIMA (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods) publications ended.  The RIM Project was initiated by A. Kirk Grayson at the University of Toronto in 1979 and over the years received extensive support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and private individuals, in particular Dr. Lawrence Shiff.  In all, it produced ten volumes in its various sub-series. Dr. Grayson retired from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a few years later found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits due to personal and family illnesses. At that time, he handed over responsibility for the work of the project to me, formerly the assistant director and at times acting director of the RIM Project. When I took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and when the last RIM volume (RIME 1 by Dr. Douglas R. Frayne) appeared in early 2008, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist. Work on several further volumes of inscriptions of Assyrian and Babylonian rulers had already begun during the time of the RIM Project and Dr. Grayson passed on responsibility for the materials and manuscripts to myself, and thus in 2007 I initiated the current project in order to continue the task of making the official inscriptions of the several important Neo-Assyrian rulers available in up-to-date, scholarly editions. While the volumes in the new series will resemble the format of the RIM volumes in most matters, the RINAP volumes will include indices of proper names and a selection of photographs. Moreover, editions of the texts will also be available online, in connection with the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc).    The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the RINAP Project research grants in 2008 and in 2010 to help carry out its work and my thanks must be expressed to it. My appreciation must also be extended to the University of Pennsylvania and to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, in whose Babylonian Section the project is based.

      "text": "In the late 1980s, A. Kirk Grayson invited Hayim Tadmor to prepare the volume of inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V for the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project. After Tadmor published his book The Inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III, King of Assyria (= Tigl. III) in 1994, he invited me to prepare the then-scheduled RIMA 4 jointly with him. In 2001, we began updating the editions of the Tiglath-pileser III corpus. In order to improve the transliterations, translations, and historical interpretations of the texts, we studied all of the published reviews of Tadmor, Tigl. III and other critical comments sent from colleagues to Tadmor himself. The corrections in Addenda et Corrigenda of the second printing of Tigl. III (2008), which appeared after Tadmor’s death (December 11, 2005), reflect a portion of our collaborative efforts on this group of texts. Numerous other additions and corrections that Tadmor and I discussed have been incorporated into the present volume. Between 2001 and early 2007, our collaborative efforts were more or less suspended, mainly due to personal obligations but also because the fate of the RIM Project was in jeopardy due to funding problems. When Grant Frame decided to revive the Assyrian Periods sub-series of the RIM Project (RIMA) at the University of Pennsylvania in a new series, I resumed my work on inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V. To facilitate production of the book and at the personal invitation of Grant Frame, I worked for about six months in Philadelphia, in the Babylonian Section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (June–November, 2007). During that time, I wrote most of the introductions and commentaries, updated the bibliographies, and prepared the editions of texts that were not included in Tadmor, Tigl. III. Thus, I am responsible for most of the content in RINAP 1 that deviates from Tadmor’s original publication; my research owes much to Hayim Tadmor’s work.    It is my pleasure to acknowledge the individuals at the University of Pennsylvania who aided me in the production of this volume. Jamie Novotny not only helped with the initial computer entry of the editions published in Tadmor, Tigl. III and the preparation of the penultimate and ultimate manuscripts (2010–2011), but also with the collation of objects in the British Museum (London) and Vorderasiastiches Museum (Berlin) and the preparation of the bibliographies, indices, and images. Furthermore, he carefully reviewed the editions and suggested restorations for damaged text based on parallel passages in other late Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, a task facilitated by the electronic tools provided by the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc) Project created by Steve Tinney. Grant Frame, the director and editor-in-chief of the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period Project, always supported our research, attentively followed its progress, and provided useful feedback. Steve Tinney offered unfailing and indispensable support for generating the camera-ready copy and the full-indexed and lemmatized online version. Several student assistants helped in the completion of the volume: Hezekiah Akiva Bacovcin, Andrew Knapp, and Irene Sibbing Plantholt. Erle Leichty and Barry Eichler were friendly hosts during my repeated and extended trips to the Babylonian Section (2007–2011). My deepest gratitude is offered to all of them.    The penultimate manuscript was read by three external reviewers: Eckart Frahm, Wilfred Lambert, and Nicholas Postgate. They made astute comments and useful criticism on numerous points on the transliteration and translation, from philological and historical viewpoints. Their critical notes helped me to substantially improve the accuracy of the editions and statements made in the introductions, commentaries, and on-page notes. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of them for their cooperative attitude and for spending considerable time and energy improving this volume.    Because Tadmor made extensive collations of many of the original texts for his 1994 publication, the inscriptions were generally not recollated from the originals for RINAP 1. Tadmor was indebted to many people for their assistance in museums or aid in other manners in the preparation of that book. These individuals were acknowledged in Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. vii–x. I hope I will be forgiven for not fully repeating those acknowledgments here, although I am well aware that the present volume indirectly benefitted from their assistance. My own museum work for this volume took me to Berlin and Paris and, therefore, I would like to thank Joachim Marzahn and Ralf B. Wartke at the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), and Béatrice André-Salvini and Ann Mettetel-Brand at the Musée du Louvre (Paris) for their assistance and for permitting me to work on objects housed in their collections.      I would also like to thank the individuals who gave me access to unpublished information about Tiglath-pileser III’s stone slabs discovered by the Polish excavation at Nimrud in 1976. Franciszek Stȩpniowski (University of Warsaw) and Richard Sobolewski (Polish Center of Archaeology) were generous enough to correspond with me, providing me with useful information. Sam Paley ז״ל  (The University at Buffalo, State University of New York) set at my disposal several unpublished electronic photographs of slabs. Andrzej Reiche (National Museum of Warsaw), with the permission of Piotr Bieliński (Director of the Polish Center of Miditerranean Archoelology, University of Warsaw), very generously photographed and sent to me an unpublished inventory of slabs from Nimrud. Daisuke Shibata (University of Tsukuba) helped me by bridging the gap between me and German and Polish researchers and by providing me with copies of articles from Heidelberg.    My work was financially supported by grants from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, as well as the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Tsukuba allowed me to take several leaves of absence, permitting me opportunities to work on this volume abroad. I sincerely appreciate all of these institutions’ support. Moreover, I am grateful to Stefan Maul, who has accepted me at the Seminar für Sprachen und Kulturen des Vorderen Orients—Assyriology at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg and who has offered me a comfortable place to work in the library there for the final period of my work on this volume.    Regrettably, I cannot show this volume to Miriam Tadmor, who kindly granted me access to files of her late husband, as she passed away on November 19, 2009. I wish to note here my fond memories of Hayim Tadmor and state that I have had a delightful time working on this material and that I have enjoyed the opportunity that he has given me.

      "text": "The volumes in the RINAP series are modeled upon the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM), with a few modifications, in particular the addition of indices of proper names and a few photographs. Like the RIM volumes, the volumes in this series are not intended to provide analytical or synthetic studies, but rather to provide basic text editions that can serve as the foundations for such studies. Thus, extensive discussions of the contents of the texts are not presented, and the core of each volume is the edition of the relevant texts.    In this volume, the order of the texts is based for the most part upon the following two criteria:    (1) The city at which the structure dealt with in the building or dedicatory portion of the text was located. If that information is not preserved in what is preserved of the text, the provenance of the inscribed object is the determining factor.     (2) The type of object upon which the inscription is written (prism, cylinder, tablet, etc.).      The system of numbering the text throughout the series is more straightforward than that of the RIM series, as the numbering comprises only the name of the ruler and the text number; for example, RINAP 1 Tiglath-pileser III text no. 1 is “Tiglath-pileser III 1” and RINAP 1 Shalmaneser V text no. 1 is “Shalmaneser V 1.” Should one be inclined, one could apply the RIM system of numbering inscriptions in its Assyrian Periods sub-series. Therefore, RINAP 1 Tiglath-pileser III text no. 1 and RINAP 1 Shalmaneser V text no. 1 could be referred to as “A.0.108.1” and “A.0.109.1” respectively. These are to be interpreted as follows: A = Assyrian Periods; 0 = Inapplicable Dynasty; 108 = Tiglath-pileser III and 109 = Shalmaneser V; and 1 = Text 1.    Following the practice of the RIM series, inscriptions that cannot be assigned definitely to a particular ruler are given text numbers beginning at 1001. Certain other inscriptions that provide information relevant for establishing royal names and titles (e.g. “servant seals”) and any composed in the name of another member of the royal family (e.g., royal wives) have been given numbers that begin at 2001.    In the volumes of the RINAP series, the term “exemplar” is employed to designate a single inscription found on one object. The term “text” is employed to refer to an inscription that existed in antiquity and that may be represented by a number of more or less duplicate exemplars. In these editions exemplars of one text are edited together as a “master text,” with a single transliteration and translation. The numbering of the ”exemplars” of some of the units of Tiglath-pileser III’s Kalḫu Annals (text nos. 1–34) and a few of that king’s summary inscriptions (text nos. 39–45) requires explanation because of the unusual nature of the source material. In numerous instances in this volume, a “text” (or more accurately, part of an inscription in the case of the Kalḫu Annals) is known only from one or more nineteenth-century (draft and/or published) copies. In such cases, the actual inscriptions are no longer available for firsthand study since the original slabs were left in the field. Each hand-drawn facsimile of a single “text” is regarded as a different version of the same “exemplar” because the copies all stem from the same inscribed object. For these texts, each copy is assigned the same “exemplar” number, but with a different lowercase letter appended to it to differentiate the various sources of information about what is on the exemplar. Text no. 13, for example, was on a single exemplar, but is now known only from several nineteenth-century copies. Because all of the hand-drawn facsimiles stem from the same ancient source, an inscribed and sculpted orthostat that lined a wall of Tiglath-pileser III’s palace, the various copies are regarded as one exemplar. Thus, exs. 1a and 1b are A.H. Layard’s draft and published copies, ex. 1c is a draft copy by H. Rawlinson, and exs. 1d and 1e are G. Smith’s  in situ  collation notes and draft copy (which was made from a cast then in the British Museum). This system of numbering introduced in RINAP 1 is also used for (1) texts that are known from casts once in the British Museum (but now destroyed or lost) and from modern hand-drawn facsimiles (see text no. 43); and (2) texts known from a now-damaged original and from one or more nineteenth-century copies that preserve text now lost (see text no. 30). With regard to the latter scenario, fragments of the same slab housed in different museum collections are each given their own “sub-exemplar” number; this is to present the information in the “Dimensions” column of the catalogue more clearly and to provide more accurate information in the “cpn” column when some fragments were collated from the original while others were collated from photographs. For example, text no. 15 is preserved in a single exemplar, but the extant text of this unit of the Kalḫu Annals is now known from a fragment of a slab in the British Museum (ex. 1a = BM 124961, which was collated from the original), from another fragment of the same orthostat in the Detroit Institute of Arts (ex. 1b = inventory no. 50, 32, which was collated from a photograph), and from A.H. Layard’s draft copy (ex. 1c = Layard, MS A fols. 66–67 and 111), which he made in the field and which includes text not preserved on either of the two fragments. Objects whose attribution to a particular text is not entirely certain are given exemplar numbers that are followed by an asterisk (*); for example, AO 11500 is regarded as text no. 53 ex. 1*, rather than as text no. 53 ex. 2, since it is uncertain that it is a duplicate of AO 115001 (text no. 53 ex. 1). Moreover, these exemplars are listed in separately catalogues (Catalogue of Uncertain Exemplars), beneath the main catalogue.    Each text edition is normally supplied with a brief introduction containing general information. This is followed by a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars. This includes museum and excavation numbers (the symbol + is added between fragments that belong to one and the same object), provenance, dimensions of the object, lines preserved, and indication of whether or not the inscription has been collated (c = collated with the original, p = collated by means of a photograph, (p) = partially collated from a photograph, and n = not collated). The next section is normally a commentary containing further technical information and notes. The bibliography then follows. Items are arranged chronologically, earliest to latest, with notes in parentheses after each item. These notes indicate the exemplars with which the item is concerned and the nature of the publication, using the following key words: provenance, photo, copy, edition, translation, catalogue, and study. Certain standard reference works (e.g., the various volumes of “Keilschriftbibliographie” and “Register Assyriologie” published in Orientalia and Archiv für Orientforschung respectively; Borger, HKL 1–3; AHw; CAD; and Seux, ERAS) are not normally cited, although they were essential in the collecting and editing of these texts. While the bibliographies should contain all major relevant items, they are not necessarily exhaustive; a vast amount of scattered literature exists on many of the inscriptions edited in this volume and much of this literature is of only limited historical interest.    As noted earlier, a distinction is made between major and minor variants to a “master text”; the major variants are placed at the bottom of the page and the minor variants at the back of the book. In brief, major variants are essentially non-orthographic in nature, while minor variants are orthographic variations. Orthographic variants of proper names may at times be significant and thus on occasion these will also appear on the page as major variants. Complete transliterations of all exemplars in the style of musical scores are found on the CD-ROMs accompanying the volumes and thus any reader who finds the notes on variants insufficient for his/her needs may check the full reading of any exemplar. Such scores, however, are not normally given for bricks and seal inscriptions.     Most of the inscriptions are written in Neo-Assyrian script; a few texts are written using a mixture of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sign forms. Unless otherwise indicated, the script of a given text is Neo-Assyrian.     As is the normal practice for transliterating cuneiform inscriptions, lower case Roman is used for Sumerian and lower case italics for Akkadian; logograms in Akkadian texts appear in capitals. The system of sign values in Borger, Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon, is generally followed. Italics in the English translation indicate either an uncertain translation or a word in the original language. In general, the rendering of personal names follows the PNA, however, the names of Babylonian rulers follow the spelling used in RIMB 2.    There are several differences between the RIM and RINAP styles. Among these, the most notable is that all partially preserved or damaged signs, regardless of how they are broken, now appear between half brackets (⌜ and ⌝). Thus, no partially preserved sign has square brackets ([ and ]) inserted in its transliteration; for example, [DINGI]R and LUGA[L KU]R appear in the transliteration as ˹DINGIR˺ and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ respectively. This change was made to ensure compatibility of the online RINAP editions with the standards of the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), the parent site and project where RINAP Online is housed. This change was implemented in the print version in order to present identical editions in RINAP 1 and RINAP Online. Note, however, that the translations may appear more damaged than their corresponding transliterations indicate, as the translations were prepared according to standard Assyriological practices; for example, ˹DINGIR˺ (= [DINGI]R) and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ (= LUGA[L KU]R) are translated as “[the go]d” and “king [of the lan]d,” and not “the god” and “king of the land.”    In addition to the indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications found in RIM volumes, the RINAP volumes also contain indices of proper names (Personal Names; Geographic, Ethnic, and Tribal Names; Divine, Planet, and Star Names; Gate, Palace, Temple, and Wall Names; and Object Names). Online versions of the manuscripts are maintained by Oracc and are fully searchable; moreover, the Oracc transliterations will be automatically supplied to the CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative)  repository.

      "text": "Many of the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III (744–727) and Shalmaneser V (726–722) edited in this volume have attracted scholarly interest since the very dawn of Assyriology, with the first discoveries at Nimrud (ancient Kalḫu) by Austen Henry Layard in 1845–1851. The search for new evidence for these two Assyrian monarchs, who played a crucial role in stories told in the Bible, was of prime importance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Since then, as a result of further discoveries and studies, it has become apparent that their reigns marked the beginning of the imperial phase of Assyria, and that this period of time should be regarded as a watershed in the history of the ancient Near East.   The kingdom of Assyria was first formed as a territorial state, with a provincial system, in the fourteenth–thirteenth centuries, roughly half a millennium before the reigns of the two kings whose inscriptions are edited here. During a period of weakness in the eleventh and tenth centuries, Assyria’s territorial holdings were greatly reduced, and its administrative and economic systems broke down because of the intrusion of numerous Aramean tribes and a series of bad harvests. In the ninth century, the pre-imperial phase of Assyria, rulers mounted aggressive military campaigns to recover land once regarded as the “Land of (the god) Aššur.” This  Reconquista -like advance reached its peak with the ambitious campaigns of the great conquerors Ashurnasirpal II (883–859), Shalmaneser III (858–824), and Adad-nārārī III (810–783); these three rulers led their armies on campaign almost every year. This relentless Assyrian territorial expansion, especially to the west, established an Assyrian “corridor” that led to the north Phoenician coast. With the exception of Shalmaneser III’s 856 conquest of Bīt-Adini, a state that occupied territory on both the east and west banks of the Euphrates, these rulers did not annex territory west of the Euphrates, an area beyond the traditional border of the “Land of (the god) Aššur.” Adad-nārārī III’s successors continued to wage war in Syria, as well as in other directions, e.g., against Urarṭu in the north, the Zagros countries in the east, and Babylonia in the south. The basic details are recorded in laconic references appearing in the Eponym Chronicle (Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 37–43). These campaigns, however, failed to achieve uncontested supremacy or lasting Assyrian dominion over those lands, with the end result just a show of military might.   In the first half of the eighth century, several other states grew substantially in power and rivaled Assyria’s might: in particular, Urarṭu in the north and northwest and Damascus in the west, both of which imposed their hegemony on a plethora of neighboring states. To the south and southeast, there was a decline and gradual disintegration of centralized authority in Babylonia. The cities Babylon, Sippar, and Nippur, all of which were important religious and economic centers, regularly clashed with nomadic and semi-nomadic Aramean tribes who disrupted their way of life. Moreover, the king of Babylon occasionally had to appeal to Assyria for military support. At this time, the internal stability of Assyria had also declined. This was due in part to periods of domestic instability and in part to the rise of formidable Assyrian high officials, men whose power and influence rivaled or surpassed those of the king. Far-flung campaigns, as well as victories in battle against major rival states, decreased in number, as suggested by the annual records of the Eponym Chronicle; there is also a noticeable decrease in the number of royal inscriptions. Thus, the first half of the eighth century is generally regarded as a period of Assyrian decline.    Assyria’s fortunes changed dramatically after Tiglath-pileser III — “My trust is in the heir of Ešarra (i.e., Ninurta)” — ascended the throne. In the course of his eighteen-year reign, this king reshaped the political map of the ancient Near East and made Assyria the dominant power once again. Like the strong and ambitious ninth-century rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III, Tiglath-pileser mounted campaigns in all directions. He began in the south with northern Babylonia, on the east side of Tigris, where he firmly established Assyrian control of Babylonian territory. Afterwards, he set his sights on rivals in the northwest and the west. From his second regnal year (his 3rd  palû , 743) to his sixth regnal year (7th  palû , 739), he fought with Urarṭu and its north Syrian allies. The Urarṭian army was routed, and the troublesome city Arpad in northern Syria was conquered and annexed. After that, as in an inexorable chain reaction, Tiglath-pileser rapidly conquered and annexed numerous Syro-Palestinian states, including Unqi (Pattinu), Ḫatarikka, Ṣimirra, Aram-Damascus, and the majority of the kingdom of Israel. These conquests were followed by unprecedented, large-scale two-way deportations, a new policy that disrupted the lives of tens of thousands, or perhaps hundreds of thousands, of people and radically transformed the demographic structure and cultural character of Assyria. Other rulers in southeastern Anatolia, along the Phoenician coast, and in Palestine (Israel and Judah), Philistia, and Trans-Jordan became vassals, from whom a heavy tribute was extracted annually, and symbolic acts of obeisance were regularly required. At the time the west was being transformed into provinces, the Assyrian army advanced northward into the heart of Urarṭu, a kingdom centered around Lake Van, and eastward into Median territory. In the east, rulers, weak and powerful alike, were brought into submission and their lands were subsequently turned into Assyrian provinces; their larger cities became Assyrian administrative centers. Towards the end of his reign, Tiglath-pileser’s attention turned to the south. The Assyrian king conquered Babylonia, his victory possibly won as the result of the political circumstances of the region. He not only took the traditional title “king of the lands Sumer and Akkad,” but also declared himself “king of Babylon,” something not done by his predecessors. He ascended the throne as Babylon’s legitimate king and participated in the akītu-festival by taking the hand of the god Bēl (Marduk), a role suitable only for the true and divinely sanctioned king of Babylon. With both Assyria and Babylonia under the authority a single king, new geo-political complications arose, some of which came to a head during the reigns of his successors. The inclusion of Babylon — with its strong independent tendencies — within the Assyrian empire would prove to be a thorn in the side of the kings of the Sargonid period (721–612).    Shalmaneser V — “The god Salmānu is pre-eminent” — ascended the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia upon the death of his father Tiglath-pileser III late in 727. He should have been well suited to the task since he had held an important role in his father’s administration, and because he had presumably been educated as the heir designate. Continuing Tiglath-pileser’s policies, Shalmaneser appears to have conquered and annexed several lands and cities. His expansion of the “Land of (the god) Aššur” included the absorption of Samaria, the capital of the kingdom of Israel (although the nature of its conquest has been long disputed among scholars), and possibly Samʾal and Que, kingdoms in northern Syria and southeastern Anatolia. Babylonia, which he inherited from his father, remained firmly in his hands. Although the details of his reign remain obscure, he appears to have successfully maintained the kingdom, at least for a few years. In his fifth year as king, internal strife, the details of which are recounted by his successor, brought Shalmaneser’s reign to an abrupt end. The Babylonian Chronicle states that he died, but it does not record the disruption that shook Assyria’s foundations. Under his immediate successor, Sargon II, and his descendants, Assyria not only experienced its zenith but also its decline and total annihilation as a political entity. Its legacy, however, remains to this day."

III) has been described in great detail in Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 10–25. It suffices here to give a shorter overview and to state briefly what has been published from 1994 to the present.   In 1851, Austen Henry Layard published copies of all of the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III that were discovered in his excavations at Nimrud (1845–1847) in his Inscriptions in the Cuneiform Character from Assyrian Monuments (London, 1851). Several years later, Henry Rawlinson, Edwin Norris, and George Smith, early pioneers in Assyriology, published copies of other inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III found at Kalḫu in vols. 2 and 3 of The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia (London, 1861 and 1870). In his Assyrian Discoveries (New York, 1875), G. Smith presented for the first time a running translation of the then-known corpus of Tiglath-pileser III inscriptions, primarily the Annals. His edition included many extensive textual restorations, for which he did not reveal the cuneiform sources that served as the basis of his interpretations.    The next scholarly advance is marked by the work of Eberhard Schrader, who first introduced a systematic order into the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III by classifying the texts as annals and summary inscriptions (Übersichtsinschriften and Prunkinschriften, in his terminology). In his Zur Kritik der Inschriften Tiglat-pileser’s II., des Asarhaddon und des Asurbanipal (Berlin, 1880), Schrader not only identified different series of the Annals, but also transliterated and translated several new inscriptions for the first time.    Paul Rost’s Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-Pilesers III. (Leipzig, 1893) brought the study of this king’s inscriptions to a new stage. Rost presented not only editions of the then-known texts, but also hand-drawn facsimiles. His editions, which often comprised conjecturally reconstructed running texts, were in many instances not the result of careful philological scrutiny of the original inscribed objects. Despite its shortfalls, Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-Pilesers III. served as the standard for the study of Tiglath-pileser III for many decades.   When the British resumed excavations at Nimrud in the 1950s, under the direction of Max Mallowan, new inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III, as well as numerous letters relating to his and his successor’s reigns, were unearthed. Donald J. Wiseman published the royal inscriptions in a series of articles in the journal Iraq (13 [1951], 18 [1956], and 26 [1964]). In 1962, Richard D. Barnett and Margarete Falkner published a comprehensive and well-illustrated study of Tiglath-pileser’s reliefs from Nimrud: The Sculptures of Aššur-naṣir-apli II (883–859 B.C.), Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 B.C.), Esarhaddon (681–669 B.C.) from the Central and South-West Palaces at Nimrud (London, 1962). That volume made the fundamental data for the reconstructions of the texts inscribed on stone orthostats widely available, publishing for the first time photographs of slabs housed in the collections of the British Museum, as well as original drawings that were made in the field and some of Layard’s unpublished papers.    After almost seventy years, Rost’s Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-Pilesers III. had become outdated. With the discovery of new texts and advances in the understanding of Akkadian, a new standard edition was needed. The first modern, comprehensive edition appeared in 1994, when Hayim Tadmor published his Tigl. III. Many of the complicated philological problems associated with editing texts no longer available on the original object (slabs left at Kalḫu) were resolved by carefully examining and crosschecking draft copies made in the field by Layard, Rawlinson, and G. Smith; those field and draft copies had not been published until that time. Tadmor included all of the Tiglath-pileser inscriptions known to him, including a lengthy annalistic account written on a stele reportedly from Iran and a shorter annalistic-style account inscribed on a rock cliff in Kurdistan (Mila Mergi). Tadmor’s Tigl. III presented not only new comprehensive editions, but also detailed historical and philological studies, copies, and photographs of nearly the entire corpus, including draft copies made by Layard, Rawlinson, and G. Smith.    In many regards, the present volume, RINAP 1, closely follows the text editions of Tadmor’s Tigl. III. The part of the book devoted to Tiglath-pileser III (pp. 19–153) is a rather faithful reproduction of Tigl. III in the RINAP style, but with many corrections reflecting the later collaborative work of Tadmor and Shigeo Yamada, as well as the comments and suggestions of many other scholars, which were expressed in their published reviews of Tadmor, Tigl. III.  [2]   Note also that the translations are presented in blocks of text, rather than line-by-line as they were in Tigl. III, and that the editions contain more extensive restoration of damaged text. This book includes several texts of Tiglath-pileser that Tadmor was not able to include in his 1994 publication, or that appeared after that time (for example, text nos. 2–4, 33–34, 36, and 38). Following RINAP’s editorial policy, inscriptions tentatively assigned or (incorrectly) attributed to Tiglath-pileser III (text nos. 1001–1007) and those written by his high officials (text nos. 2001–2002) and his wife (text nos. 2003–2005) are presented here. Moreover, a text written by a provincial governor (text no. 2006) on behalf of a Tiglath-pileser is arbitrarily edited in this volume since it might date to the reign of the third king of that name. None of the 1000- or 2000-number texts were included in Tadmor, Tigl. III. The small corpus of inscriptions of Shalmaneser V, including those of his wife, is treated in this volume; Tadmor did not edit these inscriptions either. For inscriptions not edited in RINAP 1, see pp. 11–12. Although the editions in RINAP 1 naturally represent an improvement over those of Tigl. III, that publication still has great merit, as it contains supplementary studies on philological and historical matters, photographs, and copies (including early drafts), all of which fall outside the scope of the present series. Thus, Tadmor, Tigl. III will serve as an excellent companion to this book.      Classification of Texts in the Present Volume    Following Tadmor’s historiographic criteria for classification of the corpus, this volume divides Tiglath-pileser III’s inscriptions into three categories: (1) annals, texts whose historical narrative is arranged chronologically (text nos. 1–38); (2) summary inscriptions, texts whose narrative is arranged in a predominantly geographical pattern (text nos. 39–52); and (3) miscellaneous texts, texts classified as labels, dedicatory inscriptions, as well as other texts that are too fragmentarily preserved to classify them as annals or summary inscriptions (text nos. 53–64).       Notes        1  Text nos. 1–34, however, actually comprise altogether a single annalistic account with many lacunae. These “texts” are referred to as the Kalḫu Annals. This inscription is a composite text composed of several series (probably originally four or five), each of which originates from a separate room in Tiglath-pileser’s palace at Kalḫu. These series are hypothetically reconstructed in this volume into three series: Series A, Series B, and Series C (see the Kalḫu Annals below). Thus, this reduces the actual number of texts to thirty-four or thirty-five.        2  For some reviews of Tadmor, Tigl. III, see: Frahm, AfO 44/45 (1997–1998) pp. 399–404; Frame, BSMS 35 (2000) pp. 93–95; George, BSOAS 60 (1997) pp. 124–125; Jas, BiOr 55 (1998) cols. 192–194; Naʾaman, Tel Aviv 22/2 (1995) pp. 268–278; Oded, IEJ 47 (1997) pp. 104–110; Schramm, Orientalia NS 68 (1999) pp. 169–171; and Streck, ZA 89 (1999) pp. 152–154. In addition, the authors also benefitted from suggestions by R. Borger, who personally delivered his notes to H. Tadmor (personal communication, Nov. 1999), as well as from our personal communication with many other scholars. Major changes/corrections from Tigl. III are noted in the on-page notes, with their reviewers cited. Not all changes or deviations from Tadmor, Tigl. III are indicated."

      "text": "Kalḫu Annals (Text Nos. 1–34)    At present there are five known annalistic texts of Tiglath-pileser III: text nos. 1–34 together represent a single text, the so-called “Kalḫu Annals,” and text nos. 35–38 each represent a different inscription. The main recension of the king’s Annals, the Kalḫu Annals — which is edited here as thirty-four texts, or more precisely thirty-four units of text — requires some explanation about its complex reconstruction. The inscription, which was composed towards the end of the king’s eighteen-year reign, was written on sculpted orthostats that decorated the rooms and corridors of his palace at Nimrud. This text represents the last and longest version of the king’s Annals. Unfortunately, barely one third, if not less, of the whole text has survived. In the mid-nineteenth century, A.H. Layard discovered many of these slabs in the ruins of two monumental buildings at Kalḫu. Some slabs were found in the unfinished “South-West Palace,” the palace being constructed by Esarhaddon in the southwest corner of the citadel mound, while other orthostats were unearthed in the “Central Palace,” the unfinished palace of Tiglath-pileser situated in the center of the citadel mound; the latter palace was later almost completely destroyed. From the find spots and the positions of the excavated slabs recorded by Layard, it can be deduced that all of the slabs were originally part of the Central Palace and that Esarhaddon had dismantled Tiglath-pileser’s unfinished royal residence and transported some of its sculpted slabs to the southwest corner of the citadel, where they were reused in his own palace; for further details, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 10–11 and the bibliography cited there.     Tiglath-pileser III was the first Assyrian king since Ashurnasirpal II — the king who had transformed Kalḫu into the chief administrative center of the kingdom — to decorate his palace with colossal sculpted and inscribed orthostats. Ashurnasirpal II’s army of scribes composed for his palace walls a single, non-annalistic “standard inscription,” a text that was copied on hundreds of slabs in the North-West Palace at Nimrud, with only minor variation in its contents. The final version of his Annals was inscribed on pavement slabs of the temple of the city’s patron deity, Ninurta, but not in his royal residence. In some regards, Tiglath-pileser followed Ashurnasirpal’s tradition of decorative reliefs and accompanying texts, but he also deviated from it. He had versions of his Annals written across several series of sculpted orthostats and had non-annalistic texts (see Summary Inscriptions below) inscribed on threshold and pavement slabs of his palace. Most of these inscribed and sculpted slabs do not survive today, with many being lost or destroyed in antiquity, by his fourth successor Esarhaddon (and possibly other Assyrian kings), or in modern times, by their excavators or local inhabitants. Sadly, we will never know with certainty how well decorated Tiglath-pileser’s palace was at the time of his death.    The wall slabs containing the Kalḫu Annals are of two types. The first type divides the surface of the orthostat into three registers, with the top and bottom registers sculpted (mostly with scenes of battle) and with a blank or inscribed middle register (Layard, Nineveh 2 p. 24). The second type utilizes the entire surface of the slab to depict images of “gigantic figures of the King and his attendant eunuchs and of the winged priests or divinities” (ibid. p. 21) and has the inscription written over the reliefs, except over “a naked limb” (Layard, Nineveh 1 p. 62).    Given the current state of preservation of the text and the fact that many of the slabs were destroyed or removed from their original positions in antiquity, it is impossible to determine which rooms in Tiglath-pileser’s palace had inscriptions and how much of the original composition survives today. Certain practices, however, can be inferred from the palace of Sargon II at Dūr-Šarrukīn (Weissbach, ZDMG 72 [1918] pp. 161–185; see also Güterbock, AJA 61 [1957] p. 68 and pl. 24). In that palace, each room contained an entire text, a complete version of his Annals, from beginning to end. Inscriptions in neighboring rooms often varied, sometimes in very minor ways. Moreover, the number of lines of text inscribed on the slabs differed from room to room. For example, the slabs in Room II were inscribed with thirteen lines of text, those in Room V with seventeen lines, and those in Room XIII with fifteen lines. [3]  Based on Sargon’s Annals, E. Schrader (KAT pp. 134–137; and Kritik, p. 20) tentatively proposed that the Kalḫu Annals were arranged in a similar manner. Thus, some rooms in the Central Palace contained a complete recension of Tiglath-pileser’s Annals and the number of lines of text written on the slabs in those rooms varied from room to room. Therefore, slabs with different numbers of lines should not have stood side by side in the same room of the palace and should have come from different rooms in that building.     Taking these criteria into account, the authors have divided the Kalḫu Annals into three hypothetical series. Slabs with seven lines of text are classified as Series A and those with twelve lines of text are classified as Series B. Both of these series are only partially preserved. The text of both Series A and Series B is generally written in the middle register of orthostats that have reliefs in their upper and lower registers (see the description above). Entry and corner slabs, however, could differ as text could be inscribed in those instances over sculpture that covered the entire surface of the slab (for example, text nos. 2–4). These two series were probably duplicates of one and the same inscription, but were written on the walls of different rooms in Tiglath-pileser’s palace. Series A and Series B were subdivided into units of text whose widths appear to have been uniform throughout. Narrow vertical bands of uninscribed space separated each unit of text. The individual units were not restricted to a single slab and thus a unit could run over parts of two adjacent slabs. It was not uncommon for a single slab to be inscribed with the end of one unit and the beginning of the next unit; for example, see Barnett and Falkner, Tigl. pl. LXXXI (text nos. 14–15) and pl. LXIX (text nos. 18–19). This arrangement of the seven-line and twelve-line series (Series A and B respectively) clearly indicates that the orthostats were inscribed in situ; this was also the case for the Kalḫu Annals written on “colossal” slabs (see Series C below). The width of the inscribed band of text (i.e., unit) varied from series to series: ca. 1.5 m for the seven-line series (Series A) and slightly more than 2 m for the twelve-line series (Series B). Twelve units of text are preserved for Series A and eight units are preserved for Series B.    Layard copied other units of the Kalḫu Annals that each contained more than twelve lines (up to twenty or thirty lines) and that were inscribed on “colossal” slabs, with the text running across images of “gigantic figures of the King and his attendant eunuchs and of the winged priests or divinities” (Layard, Nineveh 2 p. 21); the text and sculpture were both carved in a single register. These inscribed slabs are classified as Series C and they are now mostly known from Layard’s field copies. One slab, however, is in the British Museum (text no. 30) and two other slabs were photographed after their rediscovery by Polish excavators in 1976 (text nos. 33–34). The width of the bands of text on these slabs appears to have been often considerably more than 2 m. The Series C slabs appear to have originated from at least two, or possibly three, rooms of the palace.  [4]  The fragmentary condition of the texts, the many lacunae, and the fact that most of the originals are no longer available for study, make such a distinction rather conjectural. Thus, for the sake of simplification, all of these are categorized as Series C. Fourteen units of this Annals series are preserved, including text no. 33 (C, Unit x) and text no. 34 (C, Unit y), both of whose details remain obscure.     As stated above, only a small percentage of the Kalḫu Annals is preserved today, with about twice as much text missing as is preserved. There are large gaps in the texts, some spanning several years of military narration. The reports describing events of Tiglath-pileser’s 4th, 5th, and 6th  palû s (742–740; the siege of Arpad and the conquest of northern Syria), 10th  palû  (736; the campaign to Mount Nal), 12th  palû  (734; the campaign to Philistia), and 14th  palû  (732, the second campaign against Damascus) are completely missing. It is often assumed that the Kalḫu Annals were composed at the same time that some non-annalistic texts (summary inscriptions; text nos. 39–45) were placed in the palace. Because Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions include the chronological notation “from the beginning of my reign to my seventeenth  palû ,” the Kalḫu Annals should have included descriptions of events up to Tiglath-pileser’s 17th  palû  (729). Thus, accounts of the 16th and 17th  palû s (730–729) are probably missing as well. In addition to the gaps in which entire campaign reports are missing, there are numerous smaller lacunae in nearly all of the preserved narration, including the prologue and building report. With regard to the latter, only a few lines of this section are preserved. Moreover, the concluding formula (advice to a future ruler, with applicable benedictions and maledictions), if any, is entirely missing.     The presentation of the Kalḫu Annals in this volume requires some comment. One may be inclined to edit Series A, Series B, and Series C (of which there are two, or possibly three, copies) as separate texts, but this would present an already poorly preserved inscription as being even more fragmentary than it is. Such a presentation would also obscure the original contents of that text and break its chronological narrative flow. Following the arrangement of Tadmor’s Tigl. III, Tiglath-pileser’s Annals are edited unit by unit, with each unit being placed in its proper place within the larger composition. Thus, an attempt is made to reconstruct the Kalḫu Annals from all of the known series. The chronological order of the badly damaged and mostly missing military narration can be reconstructed from information included in the Eponym Chronicle (see below). The order of the units essentially follows that of Tadmor, Tigl. III, but with a few additional pieces that were not available to Tadmor (text no. 1 ex. 1c and text nos. 2–4). These additions are the fruits of the 1974–1976 Polish Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology excavations at Nimrud, work carried out under the direction of J. Meuszyński. Numerous slabs of Tiglath-pileser III were unearthed at that time, including inscribed orthostats that were discovered at the very end of the 1976 season. Meuszyński’s unexpected, tragic death in the spring of 1976 hindered the full publication of these inscribed slabs, and thus they were not included in Tadmor’s Tigl. III (see his notes on p. 37). Some unpublished photos, hand-drawn facsimiles, and the unpublished inventory of the slabs held at the Polish Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology in Warsaw were made available by Polish colleagues and other researchers (see the preface). For further details about the sources accessible to the authors, see the introductions and commentaries of text nos. 1–4 and 33–34. Further unpublished information about these texts, in particular text nos. 33–34, still might be found at the Polish Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology in Warsaw.    As stressed already, text nos. 1–34 together represent a single inscription. In this edition, like that of Tadmor, each unit, which comprises a “column” of text (seven, twelve, twenty, or thirty lines long), is treated as a separate “text” and numbered accordingly; for example, unit 1 or “column” 1 = text no. 1. The units are numbered sequentially from 1 to 25 (see below for text nos. 26–34). Information on the series and unit number within each of the three series is provided in the chart below and at the end of the introduction to each “text.” For example, text no. 1 is Series A, Unit 1; text no. 5 is Series B, Unit 1; and text no. 9 is Series C, Unit 1. This numbering deviation from that of Tadmor’s Tigl. III not only follows RINAP editorial procedures, but also aims to make Tadmor’s arrangement of the Annals easier to follow; for example, “Annals 1” immediately followed by “Annals 9” and “Annals 13*” continuing the narrative of “Annals 19*” in Tadmor’s Tigl. III are extremely difficult to follow or understand. (This numbering was the result of repeated renumbering of the Annals units over the long process of Tadmor’s research on the Kalḫu Annals; see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 23–25.) The numbering of a single unit is maintained, even when two or more consecutive units are preserved, whether they are on one single slab or on two or more slabs; this editorial aspect follows Tadmor, Tigl. III. For example, units 1–2 (Series A) are edited as text nos. 1–2 (each with seven lines), and not as text no. 1 (with fourteen lines of text). See the chart below and the Concordances of Selected Publications at the back of the book for a concordance of this volume and Tadmor, Tigl. III.    Text nos. 1–25 represent the master text of the Kalḫu Annals and text nos. 26–32 represent duplicates, which are sometimes used in the restoration of the main inscription. For the sake of continuity, the duplicates (text nos. 26–32) are edited after the master text. Two slabs whose contents still remain unknown (see above) and which are probably to be assigned to Series C (text nos. 33–34) are tentatively placed at the end of the series. With regard to the duplication of text, this occurs mostly between Series A and Series B; Series C overlaps only one line of Series B (text no. 13 line 20 = text no. 14 line 1). Moreover, since Series C is actually not a homogeneous recension of the Annals originating from a single room in Tiglath-pileser’s palace, there is duplicate text in that hypothetical series. For example, text nos. 30–31 basically duplicate text no. 13, although the former is a shorter version of the latter, and text no. 11 line 10' duplicates text no. 12 line 1'.     The distribution of extant Annals units is shown in the following table.

      "text": "Summary Inscriptions (Text Nos. 39–52)     Miscellaneous Texts (Text Nos. 53–64)       Other Annalistic Texts (Text Nos. 35–38)    In addition to the Kalḫu Annals, there are three other certain annalistic and annalistic-style texts of Tiglath-pileser III. These are written on a stele (text no. 35), an anthropomorphic statue (text no. 36), and a rock cliff (text no. 37). A fragment of a clay object from Aššur (text no. 38) may also preserve part of an annalistic text.    The inscription on the stele (text no. 35), which is reported to have been discovered in Iran, narrates events of Tiglath-pileser’s first nine  palû s (745–737); some of the  palû  reports may be omitted in this badly damaged text. The stele was inscribed and erected in celebration of his successes during the campaign of the 9th  palû  (737). The text represents a much earlier version of the Annals than the Kalḫu Annals because those recensions were written after Tiglath-pileser’s 17th  palû  (727). The inscription on a royal statue found at Nimrud (text no. 36) is also badly damaged. The extant text includes brief accounts of the campaigns of Tiglath-pileser’s 8th–11th  palû s (738–735), and thus that inscription may also represent a recension of the Annals that was composed late in Tiglath-pileser’s reign.     The earliest known annalistic-style account is written on a rock face at Mila Mergi, in Iraqi Kurdistan (text no. 37); the text is inscribed in a frame and over the image of the king. Unlike other known texts of Tiglath-pileser of this genre, the Mila Mergi rock relief narrates only the events of the 7th  palû  (739), the campaign against Ulluba. Thus, the Mila Mergi inscription is not a true annalistic text, but rather an inscription that records the details of a single campaign in the same style as other annals of this king.     Although its classification as an annalistic text is not entirely certain, an inscription preserved on a small fragment of a clay object discovered at Aššur (text no. 38) narrates events of Tiglath-pileser’s Median campaign, undertaken in his 9th  palû  (737).      Summary Inscriptions (Text Nos. 39–52)   Tiglath-pileser III’s summary inscriptions belong to the genre of building inscriptions. All of these probably commemorate the construction of his palace at Kalḫu, work that took place towards the end of his reign. When the first line of each text in this category has survived, it opens with the traditional Mesopotamian way of indicating ownership:  ekal  RN, “palace of RN.” On the basis of material and formal criteria, the fourteen known inscriptions of this category are divided into two groups: (1) summary inscriptions written on stone slabs (text nos. 39–45) and (2) summary inscriptions written on clay tablets (text nos. 46–52).     The large stone slabs inscribed with this type of text were probably pavement slabs, judging from the colossal size and shape of BM 118936 (text no. 39), the only slab inscribed with a summary inscription available for firsthand examination. The other four slabs (those bearing text nos. 40–43) were deemed by their excavators unsuitable (or too heavy) for transport back to London and were left in the field. Although those objects are no longer available for firsthand examination, it is plausible that they were also pavement slabs similar to BM 118936. A tiny fragment of a slab known only from a draft copy made by G. Smith in the field (text no. 45) may be part of this same group. Another slab with what appears to be a summary inscription (text no. 44) is known, but since it is written on a sculpted orthostat, much like the Series C Annals, that text could be part of an annalistic text. Following Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 198–203, that text is tentatively classified as a summary inscription.     Seven large and well-baked clay tablets, all with their contents written in a single column, are inscribed with summary inscriptions. None of them are complete, but the best preserved are text nos. 47 and 49. Although some of these were discovered in the early days of Assyriology, in exploratory excavations, and bear “K(uyunjik)” British Museum sigla, they may have actually been found in the Nabû temple at Kalḫu (Ezida). The tablet copies of these texts may have served as a draft or  Vorlage  for those inscribed on stone slabs.    Viewing the genre as a whole, one can divide the category of Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions into two: (1) texts with condensed accounts (for example, text nos. 39–41) and (2) texts with detailed accounts (for example, text no. 47); text no. 47, when compared to other texts, contains much more detail about the king’s achievements. The arrangement of the events described in this group of inscriptions is more or less fixed. Most of these summary inscriptions comprise a brief prologue, which contains a short list of Tiglath-pileser’s titles and epithets, a summary of the king’s military achievements by geographical region, a building report, and a concluding formula (see the schematic chart below). The campaign summaries usually begin with events in the south, then continue with those of the east and north (and northwest), and conclude with events in the west; the order is counterclockwise. Breaking from the chronological arrangement of the Annals, the military narration of the summary inscriptions divides the text into the following main units: (1) the Babylonian wars fought in 745 and 731–729; (2) the Zagros campaigns of 744 and 737; (3) the wars with Urarṭu and its allies in 743, 739, and 735; (4) the conquest of northern Syrian states in 742–740 and 738; and (5) the military operations in southern Syria, Palestine, and Arabia in 734–732. Note that the geographical order roughly coincides with the chronological order of the first campaign mounted in each of those directions: Babylonia in the south (745), the Zagros in the east (744); Urarṭu in the north (743); northern Syria in the northwest (742); and Philistia, the Egyptian border, and Arabia in the west (734). It is hard to say whether the king’s military targets were predetermined in this fixed geographic pattern and the original plan was slightly modified later for practical reasons, or if this is just pure coincidence. For a historical reconstruction of Tiglath-pileser’s reign, summary inscriptions are of lesser value than annalistic texts, but they are of utmost importance for filling in the many gaps in the Kalḫu Annals. The building account, which is preserved only in text no. 47, describes in detail the construction of a palace. The work was begun only towards the end of the king’s reign and was probably never completed, as excavators unearthed some sculpted and inscribed slabs that were unfinished; see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 238–258 (Supplementary Study B), esp. pp. 257–258.     Since the same chronological notation “from the beginning of my reign to my seventeenth  palû ” appears in text no. 40 line 3, text no. 47 obv. 5, and text no. 51 line 5, it is assumed here that all of the summary inscriptions were written in the same year, except text no. 46, which was composed before the Syro-Palestinian campaigns of 742–734. Text no. 39 may have also been written prior to Tiglath-pileser’s 17th  palû ; for the evidence, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 269–272 (Supplementary Study E). Therefore, most of Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions were composed ca. 729.     The distribution of geographically separated episodes preserved in the known summary inscriptions is summarized in the chart below, which is based on Tadmor, Tigl. III p. 119 fig. 7, but with some modifications.

      "text": "Uncertain Texts (Text Nos. 1001–1007)   Seven texts fall into this category and the objects upon which they are written are a clay vessel, enameled tiles, a bead, several stone objects, and a glazed brick. The attribution to Tiglath-pileser III is probable in some cases. However, Tilgath-pileser II may be the better candidate for a few of these texts. Most of the texts edited as 1000 numbers have been included here arbitrarily.   Texts Belonging to Officials and Royal Women (Text Nos. 2001–2006)    Six inscriptions fall into this category: a building inscription of Ninurta-bēlu-uṣur written on a pair of lions placed in the West Gate of the city Ḫadattu, modern Arslan Tash (text no. 2001); a votive inscription of Aššur-rēmanni, a servant of Tiglath-pileser III, dedicated to the god Adad and written on a metal disk discovered at Tell Taʿyinat (text no. 2002); three inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III’s queen and wife, Yabâ — a funerary inscription written on a stone tablet and two gold bowls, all of which were discovered during Iraqi excavations (1989) of a tomb that was hidden under the pavement of a room in the domestic wing of the North-West Palace at Kalḫu (text nos. 2003–2005); and a brick inscription (provenance not known) of Kīdītê, a provincial governor, dedicated to a Tiglath-pileser, possibly the third king with that name (text no. 2006).    Texts Excluded from This Volume    The text on a stele from Tell Abta commissioned by Bēl-Ḫarrān-bēlu-uṣur, who held the office of palace herald during the reigns of Shalmaneser IV and Tiglath-pileser III (see Radner, in PNA 1/2 p. 301), mentions Tiglath-pileser III by name; Shalmaneser’s name was erased and Tiglath-pileser’s name written in its place. Although this text belongs to the corpus of texts edited in this volume, it is excluded since it was edited in Grayson, RIMA 3 (A.0.105.2). Numerous other texts were written during Tiglath-pileser III’s reign, but they fall outside the scope of this volume. These are three land grants (Kataja and Whiting, SAA 12 nos. 14–15 and 75), administrative documents, and royal correspondence found at Kalḫu (Postgate, Governor’s Palace; Dalley and Postgate, Fort Shalmaneser; and Saggs, Nimrud Letters). Three chronographic texts, the Eponym Chronicle and two Babylonian chronicles, record the events of his reign. The relevant passages of those texts are translated below (pp. 17–18). Bar-rakib, king of Samʾal and a vassal of Assyria, refers to Tiglath-pileser in an Aramaic inscription of his (KAI no. 217). The Bible (II Kings 16:7, 10, etc.) also mentions his military activities in and around the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. For other references to him, including those using his byname Pūl(u) (meaning uncertain) in Akkadian, Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek traditions, see Brinkman, PKB pp. 240–243, with n. 1544."

      "text": "Texts Excluded from This Volume       Only a small number of contemporary Akkadian inscriptions are known from the short and poorly documented reign of Shalmaneser V (726–722). The extant corpus comprises nine short proprietary inscriptions that were written on bronze lion weights, all of which were discovered by A.H. Layard in the mid-nineteenth century at Kalḫu (text nos. 1–9). The weights were first thoroughly edited by E. de Vogüé in CIS 2/1 (pp. 1–13). These weights and the texts on them have remained a subject of scholarly interest. The comprehensive studies and editions of T.C. Mitchell (in Gyselen, Prix pp. 129–138) and F.M. Fales (Studies Lipiński pp. 33–55) provided a solid base for the editions published in this volume.   Six further inscribed objects have been thought by some scholars to be dated to his reign. These are two clay cones from Aššur (text no. 1001), a brick from Tell Abu Marya (ancient Apku) (text no. 1002), a bronze lion weight from Kalḫu (text no. 1003), and two unprovenanced clay ovals that are stamped with an image of a lion weight (text no. 1004). The assignment of these objects to Shalmaneser V is uncertain at best; the attribution of the clay cones (text no. 1001) to him seems especially improbable.    Two objects, a gold bowl and an electrum cosmetic container (text nos. 2001–2002), bearing proprietary inscriptions of Bānītu, queen of Shalmaneser V, were discovered in 1989 during Iraqi excavations of a tomb that was hidden under the pavement of a room of the North-West Palace at Kalḫu. These inscriptions, together with some inscribed objects belonging to other queens unearthed from the same tomb, were first edited by Kamil in Damerji, Gräber pp. 14–15.

The letters written in the nickname (or birth name) of Shalmaneser V — Ulūlāyu, “(One born in) the month Ulūlu” — all addressed to the king (Tiglath-pileser III), were discovered at Kalḫu in the 1950s and published by H.W.F. Saggs in Iraq 18 (1956), Iraq 21 (1958), and Saggs, Nimrud Letters. These important texts were recently re-edited and discussed by K. Radner (AfO 50 [2003/4] pp. 95–104). A few chronographic texts (the Eponym Chronicle and two Babylonian chronicles) record the events of his reign. The relevant passages of these texts are translated below (pp. 17–18). For other scattered references, certain or uncertain, to Shalmaneser V in cuneiform sources, see H. Baker, PNA 3/1 p. 1077 sub Salmānu-ašarēd no. 5. He is also mentioned in the Bible (II Kings 17:3-6 and 18:9-11), as well as in later Aramaic and Greek sources; see Brinkman, PKB p. 244 for references."

      "text": "Tiglath-pileser III's Building Activities       Tiglath-pileser III: Origin and Accession    The rise of Tiglath-pileser III to the Assyrian throne is recorded in the Eponym Chronicle. That text states that he became king in the month Ayyāru (II) of 745, the year following a revolt in the capital Kalḫu (746), a period during which the reign of Aššur-nārārī V must have come to an end. The fact that Tiglath-pileser rose to power during this disturbance and the fact that he mentions his ancestry only once, in a minor inscription (text no. 58), may suggest that he was a usurper who seized the royal throne by force, and not the designated successor. If the statement about his parentage on bricks from Aššur (text no. 58) is indeed true, then Tiglath-pileser was a son of Adad-nārārī III and the brother of his immediate predecessor, Aššur-nārārī V. Moreover, if that statement is correct, then the contradictory statement about him in one copy of the Assyrian King List (Grayson, RLA 6/1–2 [1980] p. 115) that claims he was “the son of Aššur-nārārī (V)” should be regarded as a scribal error. In sum, Tiglath-pileser was a member of the ruling royal family, but he had not been appointed crown prince, and thus he was not in line to be king. It is possible that he had been a high-ranking officer or courtier prior to seizing the throne, and that he became king somewhere between the age of forty and fifty; see the introduction to text no. 58 and Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 73–74.    Tiglath-pileser III’s Military Enterprises   Tiglath-pileser III conducted a large-scale military campaign in almost every year of his reign, and thus built a great empire in a single reign. In this regard, it is unfortunate that only one-third or less of the entire text of the Kalḫu Annals is preserved today. The gaps in those recensions of the Annals are, however, filled in by other annalistic and annalistic-style texts, especially those on a stele from Iran (text no. 35) and on a rock face at Mila Mergi (text no. 37), as well as by some accounts in his summary inscriptions (text nos. 39–53), the contents of which are presumably mostly extracted from the Annals. A chronological reconstruction of Tiglath-pileser’s campaigns is possible because this information is preserved in the Eponym Chronicle and Babylonian Chronicle (see below for translations). The former lists in chronological order the targets of this king’s campaigns, and the latter records some of the details of the individual expeditions. Using those two chronographic texts, we can follow with reasonable certainty the progress of Tiglath-pileser’s conquests and territorial annexation, as shown in the chart below, filling in the many gaps in the Kalḫu Annals and in the extant summary inscriptions. For a more detailed description of his military campaigns, see for example, Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 74–83; and Baker, PNA 3/2 pp. 1329–1331 sub Tukultī-apil-Ešarra no. 3.

Tiglath-pileser III’s Building Activities   Limiting our scope to the evidence originating from the royal inscriptions edited in this volume, and excluding contemporary royal correspondence and later evidence, Tiglath-pileser III’s building activities were mostly concentrated at Kalḫu, where he built a palace towards the end of his reign. The palace was called the “Cedar Palace” ( ekal erēni ), according to the most detailed account of the project, which is preserved in the building report of text no. 47 (rev. 17'–36'), as well as in a fragmentary passage of the Kalḫu Annals (text no. 25). Its plan included a Syrian-style portico called a  bīt-ḫilāni  and its interior was decorated with a variety of imported woods. Cedar beams from the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon (Mount Sirāra) were used to roof the palatial halls. The walls of this palace, called the “Central Palace” by its first excavator A.H. Layard, were lined with large sculpted and inscribed stone orthostats; these slabs bore copies of the lengthy Kalḫu Annals (text nos. 1–34). Some of its floors and thresholds were paved with inscribed stone slabs. Unlike the walls, the floor slabs were inscribed with summary inscriptions (text nos. 39–43). Although no accounts of work on buildings other than the palace at Kalḫu are preserved in the extant corpus of Tiglath-pileser’s inscriptions, he may have worked on Ezida, the Nabû temple there, since several tablets with texts of his were discovered in that building (text nos. 49 and 51–52); see Mallowan, Nimrud 1 pp. 237–239.    Tiglath-pileser also sponsored building projects at Aššur, the evidence for which is provided by several inscribed and stamped bricks discovered in the ruins of the temples of the gods Aššur and Adad (text nos. 58–60). Moreover, he states that he carried out construction in cities located in the periphery of the Assyrian empire and in newly annexed areas. Tiglath-pileser carried out construction work at Ḫadattu (modern Arslan Tash; text no. 53) in the west and at Aššur-iqīša, an Ullubian city northwest of Assyria, which he transformed into a provincial capital (text no. 39 line 29, text no. 41 line 30', and text no. 49 obv. 10'). Archaeological evidence, namely an inscribed basalt bull, confirms the former project, whereas the latter project is attested only in textual sources.          Notes       5  For the apparent contradiction between the Eponym Chronicle and Babylonian Chronicle, see Brinkman, PKB p. 241 n. 1547."

      "text": "Reign of Shalmaneser V      Shalmaneser V was certainly the legitimate heir of Tiglath-pileser III, as shown by letters written by him to his father while he was crown prince (Radner, AfO 50 [2003/4] pp. 95–104); in these texts, he uses his nickname (or birth name) Ulūlāyu — “(One born in the month) Ulūlu” — and not his throne name Shalmaneser. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Shalmaneser V ascended the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia in the month Ṭebētu (X), shortly after the death of Tiglath-pileser III in that same month. This suggests that the royal succession occurred without any serious disturbance. There is very little textual and archaeological evidence for his short five-year reign extant today, thus little is known about his political, military and building accomplishments. Only a small number of short and uninformative contemporary inscriptions have survived from his reign (see above). The Babylonian Chronicle, a text attesting to his legitimate status as the king of Akkad (Babylonia), records that he conquered or devastated Samaria; the Bible (2 Kings 17:3–6 and 18:9–11) and Josephus (Jewish Antiquities IX 15) also credit Shalmaneser with the conquest of Samaria, which probably took place near the end of his reign. The Eponym Chronicle, which is very fragmentarily preserved for Shalmaneser’s reign, appears to record campaigns conducted in his second, third, and fourth regnal years (725, 724, and 723), but the names of his military targets are unfortunately broken away and thus remain unknown. [6]  He may have also conducted a campaign in his fifth regnal year, but the Eponym Chronicle is too badly damaged to make out what took place at that time. Since Samʾal and Que both appear to be Assyrian provinces in the reign of Sargon II, it has often been suggested that Shalmaneser annexed them. Josephus (Jewish Antiquities IX 16) states that Shalmaneser V besieged Tyre for five years; the reliability of this account is sometimes questioned.    No building activity by this king is known so far. An inscribed brick found at Tell Abu Marya (ancient Apku) is reported as belonging to Shalmaneser V (text no. 1002), and assuming the attribution is correct, this may attest to a building project of his in that city.   For more information and further discussion about his reign, see Brinkman, PKB pp. 243–245; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 85–86; Baker, PNA 3/1 p. 1077 sub Salmānu-ašarēd no. 5; Radner, AfO 50 (2003/4) pp. 95–104; and Baker, RLA 11/7–8 (2008) pp. 585–587 sub Salmanassar V.        Notes       6 The campaign mentioned in the eponymy of Bēl-Ḫarrān-bēlu-uṣur (727) took place during the reign of Tiglath-pileser, and not in that of Shalmaneser V. This is supported by the Babylonian Chronicle, which records Tiglath-pileser’s death in the month Ṭebētu (X). This does not leave enough time for Shalmaneser V to go out on campaign during his accession year. Shalmaneser apparently also stayed at home in his first regnal year. Therefore, one might restore  i -[ na ?  KUR ? ], “(the king stayed)  i [ n the land  (Assyria)],” for the entry for 726 in the Eponym Chronicle."

Each ancient Mesopotamian year has been given a single Julian year equivalent even though the ancient year actually encompassed parts of two Julian years, with the ancient year beginning around the time of the vernal equinox. Thus, for example, the fourth regnal year of Tiglath-pileser (the eponymy of Bēl-Ḫarrān-bēlu-uṣur) is indicated to be 741, although it actually began around the middle of March in 741 and ended in March 740; therefore, events which took place late in the ancient year “741” actually took place early in the Julian year 740."

The inscription was divided into smaller units or columns of text that were written over one or two consecutive sculpted slabs. The units were separated by narrow, uninscribed vertical bands. In this volume, each unit of annals is edited as a separate “text” (see pp. 4–8 and below for further information). The reconstructed text of the Annals covers barely one third, if not less, of the whole inscription. The Kalḫu Annals was obviously composed towards the end of the king’s reign. The known pieces may represent four or five different versions of Tiglath-pileser’s Annals. Following Tadmor, Tigl. III, text nos. 1–34 are divided into three series: Series A, the “Hall of the Seven-Line Series”; Series B, the “Hall of the Twelve-Line Series”; and Series C, the “Colossal Slabs [Series],” in which slabs originating from two or three halls are actually included to form a single composite.    Series A of the Kalḫu Annals was originally written over numerous sculpted slabs in a ca. 1.5 m wide horizontal band (column) that was placed between upper and lower registers (but over sculpture in some entryway and corner slabs), an area which accommodated only seven lines of text. The text on only six of these slabs, comprising twelve units of the Annals, is known today. These are edited as text nos. 1–4, 18–19, 23–24, and 26–29. A small portion of the original composition survives today, with the extant text comprising parts of the prologue (nos. 1–3) and parts of reports of Tiglath-pileser’s 1st  palû  (745; text no. 4), 8th  palû  (738; text nos. 26–28), 9th  palû  (737; text no. 28), 11th  palû  (735; text nos. 18–19), and 15th  palû  (731; text nos. 23–24).    Series B of the Kalḫu Annals was originally written over numerous carved orthostats in a ca. 2 m wide horizontal band that was situated between upper and lower registers, an area which accommodated twelve lines of text. The inscribed slabs of the “Hall of the Twelve-Line Series” are known from copies that A.H. Layard made while he was in the field and from originals now in the British Museum. Since the pieces that were shipped to London were damaged while in transit, Layard’s drawings (Layard, MS A) help greatly in the restoration of the reliefs, as do his draft copies of the texts. The text on only five of these slabs, comprising eight units of the Annals, is known today. These are edited as text nos. 5–8 and 14–17. A small portion of the original composition survives, with the extant text comprising parts of reports of Tiglath-pileser’s 1st  palû  (745; text nos. 5–6), 2nd  palû  (744; text nos. 6–8), 8th  palû  (738; text nos. 14–15), and 9th  palû  (737; text nos. 15–17).    Series C of the Kalḫu Annals was originally written on numerous slabs across sculpted figures in an area ca. 2–3 m wide; each slab contained twenty to thirty lines of text. The inscribed slabs of the “Colossal Slabs [Series]” are mostly known from draft copies made at Nimrud as only one of the “gigantic” orthostats was transported back to England. A few additional slabs were discovered in 1976 during the Polish excavations of Nimrud. The text on only twelve slabs, comprising fourteen units of the Annals, is known today. These are edited as text nos. 9–13, 20–22, 25, 30–32, and probably 33–34. A small portion of the original composition survives, with the extant text comprising parts of reports of Tiglath-pileser’s 2nd  palû  (744; text no. 9), 3rd  palû  (743; text no. 9), 7th  palû  (739, text no. 10), 8th  palû  (738; text nos. 11–13 and 30–32), and 13th  palû  (733; text nos. 20–22), as well as an account describing the construction of Tiglath-pileser’s palace (text no. 25). The preserved sections on two of the slabs (text nos. 21–22) parallel, but do not duplicate, each other just enough to be certain that there are at least two different recensions of the Annals represented in Series C.    The three series combined preserve parts of the Annals’ prologue, reports of Tiglath-pileser’s 1st–3rd (745–743), 7th–9th (739–737), 11th (735), 13th (733), and 15th (731)  palû s, and an account of the construction of Tiglath-pileser’s palace. Rather than presenting each series separately, and each series as a complete text, this volume edits each unit of the Annals individually and arranges the units chronologically within the narrative. Duplicate passages (text nos. 26–32) are generally placed at the end, after the last preserved unit of the Kalḫu Annals (text no. 25). Similar, but not duplicate passages coming from different recensions of Series C (text nos. 21–22), however, are edited separately and consecutively within the flow of the narrative. Therefore, each “text” in this section of the book refers to a single unit of the Annals, which may contain as few as seven (Series A) or twelve (Series B) lines of text or as many as twenty or thirty lines of text (Series C), and not, as elsewhere in this volume and in the RINAP series, to a complete text.     For this reason, the term “Lacuna” in the editions of the Kalḫu Annals is used slightly differently than for other inscriptions edited in this volume. For text nos. 1–34, “Lacuna” is used when lines are missing within the unit (i.e. “text”) itself, and “Gap” is used when text is missing between units of the Annals. For example, the lines missing at the beginning of text no. 9 are regarded as a lacuna, while the missing unit(s) of text between text nos. 4 and 5 is considered as a gap. Moreover, to facilitate the narrative flow, additional information is provided before and after the first and last lines of each edition. These pieces of information generally comprise statements such as “Continued in text no. X” or “Continued from text no. X.”"

After A.H. Layard’s excavations, the slab was cut horizontally into two pieces to facilitate its transport to Europe and thus line 4 was severely damaged. Once in Zurich, the fragments were placed on opposite walls of the gallery in which they were displayed. Because of this, their relationship to one another was long overlooked; for details on the indirect join, see Tadmor, PIASH 2/9 (1967) pp. 182–183. Utilizing a photograph of exs. 1a and 1b, the text was recopied by E. Weissert (Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. I). The new copy gave E. Frahm (AfO 44/45 [1997–98] p. 400) an opportunity to significantly improve the reading of the damaged signs in line 4.    Frahm (ibid. p. 400) suggested that NA 12/76 may contain the end of the seven lines inscribed on Zurich 1918 (+) 1917; that piece (ex. 1c) is a fragment of a corner slab that was discovered during the Polish excavations at Nimrud in 1976 and that preserves part of an inscription along the central portion of its inner left surface. The exact size of the gap between NA 12/76 (ex. 1c) and the Zurich pieces (exs. 1a and 1b) is not known, although it may be small as suggested by the fact that lines 1, 5, and 6 can be restored with no missing signs between fragments. NA 12/76 (ex. 1c) has an image of a soldier sculpted in its upper and lower registers. This figure may be part of the scenes carved on exs. 1a and 1b, which include images of an Assyrian archer and a shield bearer, along with other military men. Following Frahm, NA 12/76 is tentatively regarded as belonging to the same slab as Zurich 1918 + 1917. This fragment was not collated from the original since the object was left in the field. It was, however, collated from photographs published by R. Sobolewski and E. Bleibtreu, from an unpublished excavation photograph that was in the possession of H. Tadmor (possibly supplied by the late J. Meuszyński), as well as from an electronic photo supplied by S. Paley to S. Yamada. Moreover, a partial copy of the inscription is found in an unpublished inventory of slabs held at the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archaeology (Warsaw). Due to the poor quality of the available photographs, the preserved text on ex. 1c is difficult to read. That piece is tentatively read as: 1) - ru-a  AB ?  BA ?   x x ; 2) AN/TI ?  AL/ŠID ?   x ; 3)  x x x ma ? ; 4)  šu-ri -⸢ in ? - ni ? ⸣; 5)  mal -⸢ ki ⸣  x x-ti ; 6)  na-ki-ri šá ḫur-sa -⸢ a ? - ni ? ⸣; and 7)  ú x x x x .

This unit of the Annals has been overlooked and has not been previously edited. The extant text, which comprises the beginning of seven lines, is written over the right side of an image of a sacred tree; see Bleibtreu, Flora pl. 6b. The text was not collated from the original since NA 12/76 was left in the field. However, it was collated from a photograph, as well as from a copy found in an unpublished inventory of slabs held at the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archaeology (Warsaw) (see the commentary to text no. 1).    Although text no. 3 is a continuation of this text, the length of the gap between the two texts is not known. More specifically, it is uncertain how many signs are missing at the end of text no. 2 lines 1–7 and at the beginning of text no. 3 lines 1–7, and if this text and text no. 3 are actually different units of the Kalḫu Annals (Series A). Since the ends of text no. 3 lines 1–2 do not appear to have been continued in the beginnings of lines 2–3 of this text, it seems unlikely that text nos. 2 and 3 are part of the same Annals unit. Thus, they are edited separately.

The seven lines of text are preserved on the left outer side of the object. As R. Sobolewski has suggested, slab NA 9/76 is inscribed with the last words of the final seven lines of the inscription’s prologue and the beginning of these lines “must have been on another slab positioned at a right angle to 9/76” (ZA 71 [1981] p. 267); see below for further details. The extant text contains several epithets of Tiglath-pileser III. Text no. 4, a unit of the Kalḫu Annals reporting on events of the king’s 1st  palû  (his accession year, 745), is inscribed on the right outer side of the same corner slab after a divider (a narrow, uninscribed vertical band). Unlike most of the other sculpted orthostats in the Hall of the Seven-Line Series (Series A), which have reliefs carved in the upper and lower registers (with seven lines of text written between them), at least one of the two Annals units preserved on slab NA 9/76 is written over sculpture. Text no. 4 is inscribed over the image of a large left-facing wingless genius whose right hand is raised in a gesture of benediction toward those entering the hall. The left outer side of the slab, upon which text no. 3 is written, is not sufficiently preserved for it to be know what type of sculpture that unit of the Annals was inscribed over. This arrangement of text and image is used only on corner slabs; the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Kalḫu also employs this combination of text and image.     This fragment was not collated from the original or from a photograph since the object was left in the field and since no photograph of the inscription is known. Therefore, the edition is based on an unpublished copy that was in the possession of H. Tadmor (possibly supplied by the late J. Meuszyński) and on another copy found in an unpublished inventory of slabs held at the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archaeology (Warsaw). A few of the restorations provided in the translation are conjectural. For the relationship between this text and text no. 2, see the commentary to text no. 2.

The beginning and end of this section of the Kalḫu Annals are completely broken away, and thus it is uncertain how many lines of text were originally inscribed on this orthostat. The extant portion of this Annals unit, which follows text no. 8 after a gap of unknown length, contains the end of a report of events of Tiglath-pileser’s 2nd  palû  (744; lines 1'–2'a) and the first part of an account of events of his 3rd  palû  (743; lines 2'b–16'), a year in which he did battle in northern Syria with the Urarṭian army and its Anatolian and north Syrian allies. The Eponym Chronicle records for the year 743 (the eponymy of Tiglath-pileser) that “the land Urarṭu [was defea]ted at the city Arpad” (Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 43 and 59).

This unit of the Annals, however, was copied in the field by A.H. Layard  (MS A pp. 69–70; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XIII) and H. Rawlinson (Notebook 1 fols. 123r–122v [see below]; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XIV). Rawlinson made a draft of the text for his private use at Nimrud, probably during 1853–54. The unusual numbering of the folios in Rawlinson, Notebook 1 is due to the fact that Rawlinson had flipped his notebook upside down after numbering the pages and before copying the inscriptions. Thus, the texts were copied upside down in Notebook 1, with the hand-drawn facsimile starting in the bottom of what should have been the right-hand page (i.e., now the top of the left-hand page). Therefore, recto (according to the original page numbering) preceded verso. For example, Rawlinson's copy of this text begins on 123r (now the left-hand page) and continues on 122v (now the right-hand page).    Layard copied the text in two fragments: the left fragment (which he designated as “a” in his field journal) preserves parts of fourteen lines (= the left part of lines 3'–16'); and the right fragment (which he designated as “b” in his field journal) preserves parts of sixteen lines (= lines 1'–2' and the right part of lines 3'–16'). In contrast, Rawlinson copied the extant text as a single inscription; he did not indicate the space taken up by the sculpted figure over which the inscription runs. The inscription was not collated since the original was not available for study. The present edition is based on the copies of Layard and the draft copy of Rawlinson.

Layard  (MS A p. 51; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XVIII), is inscribed on the same colossal slab as text no. 11. It is written on the left half of the slab, while text no. 11 is written on the right half of the slab (as given in Layard, ICC p. 45 bottom). The colossal slab, which was left at Nimrud, is reported to have had an inscription written “across [a] colossal figure holding a mace” (Layard, ICC p. 45; see Barnett and Falkner, Tigl. p. 30).    The slab appears to contain two consecutive units of the Kalḫu Annals, rather than a summary inscription as previously thought; for details, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 219–220 (Excursus 2). Taking into account the facts that text no. 12 directly continues the narrative of text nos. 10–11 and that that unit of the Annals records the fall of Unqi in Tiglath-pileser’s 8th  palû  (738), this text must therefore contain an account of events of the year before, i.e., the 7th  palû  (739), when Ulluba was attacked (Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 44 and 59).

Smith published a copy of the text from the same squeeze (BM 123), which was once in the British Museum (3 R pl. 9 no. 1); that squeeze is now lost or destroyed. Prior to the publication of 3 R, G. Smith made several drafts (Notebook 5 fols. 11v–12r [= draft a] and  fols. 57v–58r [= draft b], and Notebook 12 fols. 1v–2r [= draft c]; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXIV); these contain text that was not incorporated in 3 R. Probably a short time after the lithographic plates of 3 R had been prepared, G. Smith found and copied additional squeezes of this unit of the Kalḫu Annals; for the evidence, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 34–35 (Ann. 25).     The exact provenance of the slab, its size, and the details of its relief are not recorded. Although G. Smith’s copies have twelve lines of preserved text, it is assumed here that this slab does not belong to the 12-line series (Series B), but rather to the general category of the “Colossal Slabs” series (Series C). The slab appears, however, to be much narrower than some of the other slabs classified as Series C, i.e, text nos. 9 and 13. The contents of line 1' also appear in text no. 11 line 10', and thus text nos. 11 and 12 are duplicates. Because the original was not available for study, the present edition is based on the copies of G. Smith.

This unit of the Kalḫu Annals, which follows the narrative of text no. 12 after a short gap, continues the report of events of the king’s 8th  palû  (738), the year in which the king marched to northern Syria. The passage describes the annexation of Unqi, Ḫatarikka, and Hamath, i.e., the Orontes valley and northern Syria (lines 1–11a); the resettlement of captives in two northwestern provinces (lines 11b–12); and a campaign against Arameans in Babylonia conducted by Tiglath-pileser’s officials (also in 738; lines 13–20). This text mentions a certain Syrian ruler by the name of Azriyau (Azrī-Iāu), but the name of the land over which he ruled is not known; Ḫatarikka (biblical Hadrakh) and Judah are possibilities (see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 273–274 [Supplementary Study F]). With regard to the Babylonian campaign, its apparent aim was to take thousands of captives and to quickly resettle them in newly established and reorganized provinces in the northwestern part of the kingdom and in Syria. Tiglath-pileser appears to have stayed in the land Ḫatti that year, personally overseeing this major task in the west. This text, which corresponds to Ann. 19* in Tadmor, Tigl.

The published copies are: (1) Layard, ICC p. 65; and (2) 3 R pl. 9 no. 3 lines 22–41. The composite text, which is based on the edition presented in Tadmor, Tigl. III, essentially follows G. Smith’s reconstructed text (3 R pl. 9 no. 3 lines 22–41). For further information about these sources, including a chart showing the stemma of manuscripts of the main text, and an analysis of G. Smith’s work, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 32–33 (Catalogue of Annals Units, Ann. 19*) and pp. 216–217 (Excursus 1). Discrepancies in the copies are often presented in the on-page notes.    The fragmentarily preserved text partially duplicates text no. 30 and text no. 31, both of Series C, and the text is restored from those inscriptions.

Unlike most of the texts edited in this volume, this part of the Kalḫu Annals is a composite that is composed of (1) text preserved on a badly damaged and fragmentary slab in the British Museum (BM 124961 = Layard, ICC p. 50 top, and Barnett and Falkner, Tigl. pl. LXXXI), (2) text now lost but known from a draft copy made by A.H. Layard (MS A p. 110; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. IX), and (3) text restored from other units of the Kalḫu Annals (from Series A and C; see below). The composite text, like Tadmor’s edition in Tigl. III, essentially follows G. Smith’s reconstructed text (3 R pl. 9 no. 3 lines 41–52). For an analysis of Smith’s work, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 216–219 (Excursus 1).     The primary source for this text is the left column of BM 124961, which is supplemented by Layard’s draft copy, as it preserves text now missing on the original. About ten signs are missing at the beginning of lines 1–7 and about five signs at the beginning of lines 8–12. These parts of the text are restored from duplicate passages in Series A and C.

The text, which is probably a direct continuation of the previous unit of the Annals, preserves the end of a report of events of the king’s 9th  palû  (737). Some of the lands attacked in this campaign — Bīt-Kapsi, Bīt-Sangi, and Bīt-Urzakki —  had been the target of Tiglath-pileser’s first campaign to Media (744), while others, e.g. Sumurzu, had been annexed as Assyrian provinces (see text no. 7 lines 1–7 and text no. 8 line 6). The fact that Tiglath-pileser mounted a second campaign to this area suggests that Assyrian hold over these lands had loosened or had ended during his prolonged involvement in the West (743–738).

With regard to the first unit on the slab, this text, the beginning and end are completely broken away, and thus it is uncertain how many lines of text were originally inscribed on the orthostat. This section of the Kalḫu Annals follows text no. 19 after a gap of unknown length. The missing narration between the two Annals units contained the end of a report of events of the 11th  palû  (735), the entire account of events of the 12th  palû  (734), and the beginning of a report concerning those of the 13th  palû  (733). The extant portion of this text continues the narration of events of the 13th  palû  (733) and reports on a forty-five day siege of Damascus, with the total devastation of its countryside. The passage does not state that the city itself was directly assaulted. The only surviving record of the fall of Damascus is the statement in II Kings 16:9. However, G. Smith made a cryptic statement about this event in Assyrian sources: “One valuable fragment discovered by Sir H. Rawlinson which contained a notice of the death of Rezin has been left in Assyria and lost” (Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache 7 [1869] p. 14). Perhaps this was a fragment of a colossal slab that H. Rawlinson found during 1852–54 but did not transport back to England; his field journals, unfortunately, do not contain a copy of the text referred to by G. Smith. The last preserved line of text mentions Samsi, queen of the Arabs, against whom Tiglath-pileser mounted a campaign in the same year (733). This text, which Tadmor referred to as Ann. 23 in Tigl. III, represents Annals Series C, Unit 9.    Access  Tiglath-pileser III 20  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/Q003433/]    Source:    Layard, MS A pp. 115–116  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P450212/]  (Rawlinson, Notebook 1 fols. 121r–120v; G. Smith, Notebook 17 fols. 29v–30r)    Commentary   This text is inscribed on the same colossal slab as text no. 21. This Annals unit, which is written on the left half of that slab, is known only from several draft copies made in the field and several published copies because the original was left at Nimrud. A.H. Layard’s draft copy (MS A pp. 115–116, left side; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XX) is the main source for this unit of the Annals. Errors can be corrected with the help of H. Rawlinson’s draft copy (Notebook 1 fols. 121r–120v; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXI) and G. Smith’s collations (Notebook 17 fols. 29v–30r; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXII), both of which were made from the slab  in situ .    The first two lines, which contain the name Raḫiānu (Rezin), appear at the very bottom of Layard, MS A p. 115. Although these lines were omitted in Layard’s copies in MS B and ICC (pp. 72 bottom–73 top), G. Smith noticed that they were part of this section of the Annals (Eponym Canon p. 178). Layard, MS A pp. 115–116 (= Layard, ICC pp. 72 bottom–73 top) contains two different Annals units: this text (on the left) and text no. 21 (on the right). Layard wrongly copied them as if they are written as a single continuous text. This is probably a slip by Layard, who appears to have overlooked the faintly incised, vertical dividing lines separating the two units. This assumption is supported by the fact that both Rawlinson and G. Smith treated the text copied in Layard, MS A pp. 115–116 as two separate units of Tiglath-pileser’s Annals. For a detailed discussion of this problem, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 220–221 (Excursus 3). Thus, Layard’s conflated copy is treated here as two consecutive units of the Kalḫu Annals: the left part (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XX) is a copy of this text and the right part (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXIII) is a copy of text no. 21.

This Annals unit is written on the left half of the slab, while the next section of the Annals is written on the right half of the slab. A.H. Layard made a draft copy of this inscription during his stay at Nimrud (MS A p. 130; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. IV). The inscription was not collated since the original was left in the field and thus was not available for study. Therefore, the present edition is based on Layard’s copies.    Previous editions, of which all but Tadmor, Tigl. III have neglected this Annals unit, often placed text no. 24 at the beginning of the Kalḫu Annals (see G. Smith, Assyrian Disc. and Rost, Tigl.) and thus tried to explain why Tiglath-pileser III abandoned the part of Babylonia that he had subjugated in his first  palû  (745) and only returned there fourteen years later (731). H. Tadmor, using both text nos. 23 and 24, correctly placed text no. 24 in its proper chronological position within the Kalḫu Annals: in the king’s 15th  palû . This also neatly places the capture of Gezer (Gazru) (see text no. 57), which is depicted in the upper register of the same slab upon which text nos. 23–24 are inscribed, in its appropriate place in the pictorial narrative sequence, i.e., among the Syrian and Palestinian wars. For the arrangement of the sculpture slabs, see Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 238–259. Note that “ICC 34a” on fig. 11 (pp. 247–248, Wall IV) should be read as “ICC 34c” and the space for text no. 24 should be placed further to the left, thus shortening the space assigned to text no. 23 in ICC p. 34 bottom.

This passage describes the Assyrian army crossing a river, probably the Tigris, and the subjugation of Aramean and Chaldean chieftains. It also records that priestly collegiums of major Babylonian temples brought sacrificial remnants before Tiglath-pileser, which was the initial step by which the Assyrian king was offered sovereignty over Babylonia.

Rawlinson made a draft copy of this unit of the Annals (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXVI) during his stay at Nimrud, probably in 1853 or 1854, and noted the following at the bottom of the same page of his field journal:  “All this is probably Pul’s, for the stones are put carelessly together as if they formed the outer face of the walls of the guard house at the entrance of Esarhaddon’s palace.”  The statement “All this” must refer to the preceding slabs of Tiglath-pileser III copied by Rawlinson in the same notebook, i.e., the text drawn on fols. 123r–122v (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XIV = text no. 9), which carries the notation: “Plan II Wall SS, 1”; and the Annals units copied on fols. 120r–119v (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XVII = text no. 13), which has the caption: “At the entrance of Esarhaddon’s Palace.” Rawlinson does not appear, however, to have identified this four-line text, which he copied on fols. 119r–118v of the same notebook, as an inscription of Tiglath-pileser. Because of this G. Smith overlooked it. Since the above-mentioned texts copied by Rawlinson in Notebook 1 (text nos. 9 and 13) are reported to have been inscribed on colossal slabs, this text presumably belongs to the same category (Series C). Note, however, that at least one summary inscription (text no. 44) was inscribed on a sculpted orthostat like the text of the Annals (Series C) and that that text was also copied by Rawlinson in Notebook 1 (fols. 122r–121v) with other inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III that had been reused in Esarhaddon’s palace at Kalḫu (South-West Palace). Therefore, it is not impossible that text no. 25 is part of the building report of a summary inscription that was inscribed on sculpted orthostats that decorated the walls of a room of Tiglath-pileser’s palace. This suggestion is further supported by the fact that Sargon II also had summary inscriptions written on sculpted orthostats that lined the walls of his palace at Dūr-Šarrukīn (mod. Khorsabad); for details, see p. 5 (Introduction). In any case, following Tadmor, this text is edited here as part of the Kalḫu Annals. The inscription was not collated since the original was left in the field and thus was not available for study. Therefore, the present edition is based on Rawlinson’s draft copy.

It is assumed here that the inscription, which breaks off after only five lines, is continued in text nos. 31 and 32, both of which are now known only from draft copies of G. Smith and H. Rawlinson and which were inscribed further down on the same slabs from which BM 118899 + BM 118900 originate. See the commentary of text no. 32 for further information about the compositional arrangement of text nos. 30–32. C.J. Gadd (Stones p. 155) thought that H. Rassam discovered these pieces in 1853, but M. Falkner (Barnett and Falkner, Tigl. pp. 17–18) has found evidence suggesting that the slabs were actually discovered by H. Rawlinson in 1854 and sent to England by Rassam. G. Smith made a draft copy of the text (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXV).

Smith, Notebook 5 fols. 13r–13v)    Commentary   G. Smith copied this text from torn squeezes then in the British Museum (now lost or destroyed); his copy appears on the same page of his notebook as his copy of text no. 30 (Notebook 5 fols. 13r–13v; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXV top), just below that section of the Annals. The arrangement of these two copies in G. Smith’s Notebook 5 suggests that this text is a direct continuation of text no. 30. H. Rawlinson also copied the left part of this Annals unit (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XXV bottom); the text was probably written on a single fragment. See the commentary of text no. 32 for further information about the compositional arrangement of text nos. 30–32.    Lines 1–8 duplicate and are used in the restoration of text no. 13 lines 7–11; line 9 also parallels text no. 14 line 10. Curiously, this text appears to omit between lines 8 and 9 a seventeen-line passage that describes a war with Aramean tribes living on the border of Babylonia and their subsequent deportation to Syria (text no. 13 line 12–text no. 14 line 9). Rawlinson’s draft copy has only six lines of text (lines 3–8), and thus omits the problematic last line (line 9). If G. Smith’s copy is accurate, then this text represents part of an abridged version of the Kalḫu Annals; cf. the longer account now preserved in text nos. 13 and 14. The abridgement may not be accidental since the omitted passage is a stylistic intrusion into the report of Tiglath-pileser’s campaigns to northern Syria during his 8th  palû  (738).    As mentioned above, Rawlinson’s copy of this part of the Annals omits line 9. Rawlinson, however, copied that line as the first line of text no. 32. This may indicate that this text originally comprised only lines 1–8. See the commentary of text no. 32.    Bibliography    — Rawlinson, Notebook 2 fol. 4v (copy)     — G.

Rawlinson in a letter read by E. Norris at the meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1854 (Athenaeum no. 1373 p. 216; the letter is dated to 18 February, 1854) since that text is said to have contained a list of Syrian rulers subdued by Tiglath-pileser in his 8th  palû . Norris reports: “The list contains eighteen names, among which we find Rezin of Damascus, Menachem of Samaria, and Hiram of Tyre ... Several of these names are found in the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser, published by the Trustees of the British Museum (= ICC); but the list now found is far more complete than any there given.”     Lines 1–12 duplicate and are used in the restoration of text no. 14 line 10–text no. 15 line 4. Line 13, which is fragmentarily preserved, has no known parallels. The first line of the text duplicates exactly text no. 31 line 9, even the unusual spelling of Damascus (KUR. ša -ANŠE.NÍTA.MEŠ- šu-a-a ). This repetition may indicate that this passage of the Annals is a direct continuation of text no. 31, which contained only eight lines, without line 9 (see the commentary of text no. 31). Thus, text no. 31 lines 1–8 and text no. 32 represent the middle and lower parts of a unit of the Kalḫu Annals that is written over and around images of the king and one of his courtiers. Text no. 30 is inscribed on the upper part of the same slab (BM 118899 + BM 118900; see Tadmor, Tigl. III p. 36 fig. 5 for a reconstruction of the original relief and texts). The lines of this text are longer than those of text nos. 30 and 31. This is due to the fact that the inscription is not written over the king’s woolen, wavy garment; cf. the distribution of signs written on the image of the king on the Iran Stele (text no. 35). The slab, part of which comprises BM 118899 + BM 118900, may have originally borne thirty lines of text (exactly like NA 19/76 [text no. 33]). The complete Annals unit would have comprised text nos. 30–32, as well as additional lines that are now lost. Because the the original was left at Nimrud, the present edition is based on Rawlinson’s draft copy.    Bibliography    — Rawlinson, Notebook 2 fols. 5v–6r (copy)     1994 Tadmor, Tigl.

The relief, showing two standing courtiers, was found in several pieces and the inscription was reported to be very abraded and difficult to decipher. Since the slab was discovered just before the end of the dig, the inscribed fragments were not copied or photographed properly. Moreover, many of J. Meuszyński’s field notes and materials were lost after his tragic death in Turkey in 1976 (Sobolewski, private communication). The text is partly visible in a photograph of the slab published by Sobolewski and in electronic copies of unpublished Nimrud excavation photographs made from the prints (the negatives are now lost) kindly supplied by S. Paley. Although some traces of signs are legible in the unpublished Nimrud excavation photographs, not enough of the text can be read to present an edition.

At present, four texts apart from the Kalḫu Annals (text nos. 1–34) are certainly or possibly categorized as annalistic or annalistic-style texts.     At Mila Mergi, a site in the mountains northwest of Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan, Tiglath-pileser had a fifty-four-line inscription (text no. 37) written on a rock face. This text is the earliest known annalistic-style account of this king and it is unusual in that it narrates only the events of the 7th  palû  (739), the campaign against Ulluba. Thus, the Mila Mergi inscription is not a true annalistic text, but rather an inscription that records the details of a single campaign in the same style as the Annals. The Iran Stele (text no. 35) is the next earliest annalistic account of his. This text, which was inscribed and erected in celebration of his achievements during a Median campaign (737), narrates events of Tiglath–pileser’s first nine  palû s (745–737), although it may omit some of the  palû  reports. A statue from Nimrud (text no. 36), although badly damaged, may represent a recension of the Annals composed late in Tiglath-pileser’s reign; the extant text includes brief accounts of the campaigns of his 8th–11th  palû s (738–735). A fragment of a clay object from Aššur (text no. 38) may also preserve part of an annalistic text, but it is too fragmentarily preserved to classify it with certainty.         35  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/Q003448/]   Three fragments of a stone stele — with an image of the king and accompanying divine symbols carved in the typical rounded-top frame and originating from western Iran (possibly from Luristan or the region of Kermanshah) — are inscribed with an annalistic text of Tiglath-pileser III. Two of the fragments (frgms. 1–2) are now in the Israel Museum (Jerusalem) and the third fragment (frgm. 3) is in a private collection. Frgm. 1 is from the upper part of the stele, while frgms. 2 and 3, which physically join, comprise the lower part. The stele, which is in the form of a rectangular prism, is inscribed on three sides: the front (on which the image of the king is carved; = col. i), the left side (= col. ii), and the right side (= col. iii). The back, which is preserved only on frgm. 3, is uninscribed.     The inscription opens with an invocation to the gods (i 1–20) and the king’s titles and epithets (i 21–35). This is followed by reports of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd  palû s (i 36–43'); the text breaks off in the middle of the description of the 3rd  palû . After a lacuna of considerable length (more than 40 lines), the inscription continues with a geographical summary of conquests in the east (ii 1'–3') and west (ii 4'–17'), a hymn in praise of Tiglath-pileser (ii 18'–24'), and an account of the 9th  palû  (737), against Media (ii 25'–44'), the event for which this stele was commissioned and erected. The report of the 9th  palû , which bears little resemblance to the account included in the Kalḫu Annals (text no. 15 line 5–text no. 17 line 12), contains a short introduction, a statement about the erection of steles, and a list of the eastern dignitaries who delivered horses to the Assyrian king. After a short lacuna (probably fewer than ten lines) at the end of col. ii, the historical narrative ends with a list of tribute-bearing kings from the west (iii 1–23) and east (iii 24–30). This is followed by a description of the setting up of the stele (iii 31–36) and then, after a short lacuna (ca. fifteen lines), the text concludes with blessings and curses (iii 1'–10'). Although the inscription is not dated, the date of composition (737) is confirmed by the fact that the last campaign recorded in the text occurred in the king’s 9th  palû , an event that took place in 737 according to the Eponym Chronicle, and by the fact that the stele is reported to have come from western Iran.

He designated text preserved on frgm. 1 (upper part of the stele) and on frgms. 2+3 (lower part of the stele), as “A”  and “B” respectively.  Following Tadmor, Tigl. III, the text is edited here in five parts, however, his sigla (I A, I B, etc.) are not used.

The extant text contains accounts of the king’s 8th (738), 9th (737), 10th (736), and 11th (735)  palû s, respectively the campaigns to Syria (lines 1'–3'), the Zagros (lines 4'–7'), Mount Nal (lines 8'–10'), and Urarṭu (lines 11'–13'). The last three preserved lines (lines 14'–16') are too badly damaged to be certain of their contents.

According to P. Hulin (Iraq 28 [1966] p. 84), the piece, which is constructed from two smaller inscribed fragments that were joined shortly after their discovery, has a convex surface; the back part of the statue is completely broken away. The inscribed surface measures 14.6×10.3 cm. Horizontal rulings separate each line of text. For the identification of this text as an inscription of Tiglath-pileser III, rather than as a text of Shalmaneser III or Sargon II, see Fuchs, Studies H. and M. Tadmor pp. 49*–54*. Since the original was not available for study, the present edition is based on Hulin’s published copy and Fuchs’ edition.

This inscription is the earliest known annalistic-style account in the corpus of Tiglath-pileser’s inscriptions. The text opens with an invocation of ten major gods (lines 1–11) and the king’s name, titles, and epithets (lines 12–15). This is followed by a very detailed account of a campaign against Ulluba, an event that took place during his 7th  palû  (739, according to the Eponym Chronicle; lines 16–46a). The text concludes with curses and blessings (lines 46b–54). This inscription was composed during or immediately after the Ulluba campaign and it is the principal historical source for the 7th  palû . This account of the campaign is of a different chronographic tradition than either the Kalḫu Annals or Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions. Only brief references to this military expedition appear in summary inscriptions (e.g., see text no. 39 line 25 and text no. 41 line 27'), and these bear no resemblance to the military report of this inscription. The account for the year 739 in the Kalḫu Annals has survived in only one very small fragment (text no. 10). This text was edited as the Mila Mergi Rock Relief Inscription in Tadmor, Tigl. III.

The image of the king is ca. 123 cm high. Within the frame, the inscription is carved in characters some 8 to 10 mm high. Text is not written over the image of the king. Since the inscription could not be collated from the original, the present edition is based on J.N. Postgate’s published copy, which he prepared from the original, photographs, and squeezes. The edition is only moderately updated from Tadmor’s edition in Tigl. III. An additional examination of the original may clarify some of the remaining uncertain readings.    The Iran Stele (text no. 35) duplicates the beginning and end of this inscription (the invocation of gods and the curses and blessings). That text has been utilized in the restoration of damaged text in those passages.    Bibliography    1973 Postgate, Sumer 29 pp. 47–59 and figs. 1–7 (copy, photo, edition)     1994 Tadmor, Tigl.

It is assumed that this fragmentarily preserved text contains part of a report of his Median campaign, an event that took place in his 9th  palû  (737). This campaign is recorded in two versions of the king’s Annals (text no. 15 line 5–text no. 17 line 12, and text no. 35 ii 25'–44'), as well as in six summary inscriptions (text no. 39 lines 17–20, text no. 40 lines 18–19, text no. 41 lines 4'–15', text no. 46 lines 12–16, text no. 47 obv. 29-42, and text no. 51 line 20). The extant text appears to roughly follow the itinerary of that campaign, since it first mentions the land Namri (situated at the entrance of the Khorasan road not far from Assyria proper), then the land Ṣibur or Ṣibar (one of the farthest points reached during that military expedition), and finally the city Niqqu of the land Tupliaš or Tubliaš (a site close to Namri and visited during Tiglath-pileser’s return march, as implied by the Kalḫu Annals). The inscription appears to follow the style of an annalistic account, but it is not sufficiently preserved to be certain that it is not a summary inscription listing these place names in the same order. A ruling line separates the description of the Median campaign and the following campaign; ruling lines appear in both the annalistic texts and summary inscriptions of this king and the use of a section divider cannot be used as evidence to determine with more certainty this text’s classification.

VAT 12938 is the first example of an inscription of Tiglath-pileser III from Aššur written on such an object. The piece is not sufficiently preserved to determine with certainty the type of object from which it originates. The other known inscriptions of his from Aššur are on a large stone block (text no. 54), bricks (text nos. 58–60), a weight (text no. 61), and possibly enameled tiles (text nos. 1002–1003) .    Regarding the GN in line 5', E. Frahm notes that the land called Tugliaš by early Neo-Assyrian rulers, Shalmaneser III in particular, is referred to as Tupliaš (or Tubliaš) by Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II (see Parpola, Toponyms p. 358). The identification of the passage in lines 1'–5' as the campaign to Media, undertaken in the king’s 9th  palû , was proposed by A. Fuchs ( apud  Frahm, KAL 3 p. 71).

      "text": "39–52    In addition to the various recensions of the Annals (text nos. 1–38), Tiglath-pileser III had his scribes compose numerous texts summarizing his many military achievements in a set geographical pattern (text nos. 39–52). The majority of these summary inscriptions were written towards the end of his reign on large stone pavement slabs and on carved orthostats that lined the walls of his palace at Kalḫu. Like the Kalḫu Annals, many of these texts were inscribed over the surface of several slabs (text nos. 39–45). Unfortunately, due to the palace’s poor state of preservation when excavated and the exploratory nature of those excavations, we generally only have one slab, or are able to securely identify only one slab, of each of those inscriptions. We therefore have only a portion of each inscription.     Text nos. 39–40 each preserve the beginning of a text and thus the slabs upon which they are carved are the first slab in a longer series of slabs. Both inscriptions open with the traditional Mesopotamian way of indicating ownership:  ekal  RN “palace of RN.” The slabs inscribed with text nos. 41 and 45 were each probably also the first slab in a longer series, although the first preserved line of both of these inscriptions begins mid-narrative, with Tiglath-pileser’s accomplishments in Babylonia. Text no. 42  probably represents part of the second inscribed slab in a longer series of pavement slabs and text no. 44 likely originates from a middle slab in a series of slabs decorating the walls of Tiglath-pileser’s palace. The first preserved line of both of these texts also begins mid-narrative, but with summaries of the king’s conquests in the west. Lastly, text no. 43, although treated here as a summary inscription, belongs to a separate category of text; its genre cannot be determined with certainty since only a small portion of the inscription is preserved. Since that inscription contains only a list of cities and since each slab in the series was divided into two columns of text, this slab may represent one of the middle slabs of a much longer series.     Because these summary inscriptions were written on several slabs, like the Kalḫu Annals (text nos. 1–34), references to lacunae in the editions are used slightly differently than in most of the RINAP volumes. For text nos. 39–45, “Lacuna” is used only if lines are missing at the beginning and/or end of the slab upon which that inscription is inscribed. Moreover, additional information is generally provided before and after the first and last lines of each edition; these comprise statements such as “Continued from the previous slab (not preserved)” or “Continued on the next slab (not preserved).”    Several wide, single-column tablets inscribed with Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions (text nos. 46–52) are also known. Although some of these were discovered in the early days of Assyriology and bear misleading “K(uyunjik)” British Museum sigla, the tablets must actually originate from the Nabû temple at Kalḫu. These tablet copies may have served as a draft (or an archival copy) for texts inscribed on stone slabs. None of the inscriptions are complete, but the best preserved are text nos. 47 and 49. Based on text no. 47, all of the summary inscriptions may have included a building report that described the construction of Tiglath-pileser’s palace, with the exception of an earlier and shorter version represented by text no. 46. For details on the contents and the arrangement of the narrative, see the discussion of summary inscriptions in the introduction."

The slab is the first in a series of slabs that altogether contained a long summary inscription. The text opens with the formula “Palace of Tiglath-pileser” and a list of the king’s titles and epithets. This is followed by a condensed account of Tiglath-pileser’s military campaigns, which are summarized according to a set geographical principle. The following events are recorded in this text: the establishment of Assyrian domination over Arameans living in northern Babylonia and along the east bank of the Tigris (745) (lines 4–7); the conquest of Chaldea (743 and 731) (lines 8–15a); the offering of sacrifices to various Babylonian gods and goddesses (731) (lines 15b–16); the conquest of Namri and Media (744, 737) (lines 17–20a); the defeat of Sarduri, king of Urarṭu (743, 735) (lines 20b–25a); the campaign to Ulluba (739) (lines 25b–29); and the annexation of cities in Ulluba and Urarṭu (739, 736, and 735) (lines 30–36). Since the text contains an incomplete date formula ( ul-tu  SAG LUGAL- ti-ia , without its expected continuation  a-di x  BALA.MEŠ), a precise date of composition cannot be determined with certainty. Comparison of the account of the wars against Sarduri, king of Urarṭu (743, 739, 736, and 735), with accounts of the same events in other summary inscriptions (text nos. 40–41, 47, and 51) composed after the king’s 17th  palû  (729) suggests a late date of the composition. The noticeable absence of the title “king of Babylon,” however, suggests that the inscription was composed before Tiglath-pileser III ascended the Babylonian throne (729). Therefore, the most probable date of the composition is ca. 731–730. Tadmor referred to this text as Summary Inscription 1 (Summ. 1) in Tigl. III.

Layard during his first season of excavations at Kalḫu (1845–47) in the ruins of the South-West Palace. According to Layard, ICC p. 17, the inscribed slab was discovered “on the ground, before Nr. 18, Wall K, Plan II.” The slab was apparently moved by Esarhaddon’s workmen from its original location in the Central Palace and probably broken during the move to the South-West Palace, where it was to be reused in the construction of that royal residence. This is suggested by the fact that the slab was already in several pieces when Layard found it. In addition, more of the slab was lost when BM 118936 was transported from Nimrud to the British Museum. Layard’s unpublished draft copy (MS A pp. 127–128; reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pls. XLIII–XLIV) is now our only source for the missing pieces of the inscription. The text was collated from the original in the British Museum, from a photograph, and from Layard, MS A.

Loftus discovered a large stone slab inscribed with nineteen lines of a summary inscription of Tiglath-pileser III, together with another inscribed stone slab (text no. 41). After the opening formula “Palace of Tiglath-pileser” and a list of the king’s titles and epithets (lines 1–3), the text recounts some of Tiglath-pileser’s military achievements. The inscription, now badly damaged, must have originally contained a geographical summary of events that took place between his accession year (his 1st  palû ; 745) and his 17th  palû  (729), as indicated by the chronological note in line 3, and therefore it must have been composed after 729. Only the beginning of the text is preserved and the extant portions contain descriptions of events in Babylonia — i.e., the subjugation of the Arameans, sacrifices offered to the god Marduk in Babylon, and the conquest of Chaldea (Bīt-Šilāni and Bīt-Šaʾalli) (731) (lines 4–18a) — and those in the Zagros region, against Namri and Media (744, 737) (lines 18b–19). Text no. 41 partially duplicates this inscription and may contain a further summary of the events that immediately follow those preserved on this slab. Like the colossal slab bearing text no. 39, the slabs bearing this inscription and text no. 41 must have formed the first part of a series of several stone slabs in which the king’s conquests were described according to a set geographical pattern, although they represent a recension shorter than the one found in text no. 39.

According to a note accompanying Loftus’ draft copy (Notebook pp. 16–17), which is housed in the British Museum, the inscription was written on the “Back of slab No. 11, Chamber A, South West Palace Nimroud” (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XLV; see also p. 316 [Addenda et corrigenda]). The squeeze was studied by G. Smith, who made a roughly restored copy (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. XLVI), and then by P. Rost, who published a copy made from the same squeeze. Rost mistakenly thought that a single slab bore this inscription and text no. 41; for further details, see Tadmor, Tigl. III p. 128. The squeeze has since been lost or destroyed. The present edition is based on Loftus’ draft copy, but some of Rost’s improved readings and G.

Loftus on the 4th of December 1854 in the northeast corner of the South-West Palace at Kalḫu. The beginning and end of the inscription are completely missing and the extant text contains descriptions of the conquest of Chaldea (731) (lines 1'–4'a); the conquest of Namri and Media (744, 737) (lines 4'b–15'a); the defeat of Sarduri, king of Urarṭu (743, 735) (lines 15'b–26'); and the conquest of Ulluba and Ḫabḫu (739) (lines 27'–32'). Lines 1'–5' duplicate the final preserved lines of text no. 40 (lines 14–19). It is assumed that the slabs bearing this text and the previous inscription, when complete, contained duplicate texts. Therefore, this inscription must have originally contained a geographical summary of events that took place between Tiglath-pileser’s accession year (his 1st  palû ; 745) and his 17th  palû  (729), and thus must have been composed after 729.

The object was discovered in the mid-nineteenth century at Kalḫu, but left  in situ . It is probably the second slab of a long summary inscription that was written from beginning to end on three consecutive slabs; the first and third slabs of the series have not survived, save perhaps for a tiny fragment (text no. 45) containing part of a description of Tiglath-pileser’s Babylonian campaigns. The extant text contains reports of the following events in the west: the annexation of northern and central Syria (738) (lines 1'–5'a); the annexation of Damascus (733–732) (lines  5'b–8'a); the campaign against Ḫanūnu of Gaza (734) (lines 8'b–15'a); the partial annexation of Israel (733–732) (lines 15'b–19'a); the campaign against Samsi (733) (lines 19'b–27'a); the receipt of tribute from Arab tribes (733–732) (lines 27'b–33'); the appointment of Idibiʾilu as the “gatekeeper facing Egypt” (734) (lines 34'–35'); and possibly the setting up of a stele (lines 36'–38').

Smith copied the text from squeezes then in the British Museum (see Bezold, Cat. 2 p. xiv), restored the text as much as he could, and published a copy in 3 R (pl. 10 no. 2); his restorations were noted in boldface type. Prior to the publication of 3 R, G. Smith made separate copies of the individual fragments from the squeezes, which he labeled a–g (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pls.

The text of the lithographic plate in 3 R has many improved readings as compared to its earlier draft since it appears to have utilized Smith’s older copies of the individual fragments. Therefore 3 R pl. 10 no. 2 is used as the main source for the present edition. In some cases, however, the draft copies of the individual fragments have the correct signs, and thus they are noted and incorporated here. The squeezes have since been lost or destroyed.

The slab was left  in situ . The inscription, which is fragmentarily preserved, is written in two columns and the extant text contains a list of cities, arranged according to country, which are in turn listed from north to south. The areas mentioned are: Naʾiri and possibly some areas adjacent to it (i 1–11a); Enzi, another land, and Urarṭu (i 11b–24); Bīt-Agusi (i 25–ii 7); Unqi (ii 8–15); Hamath (ii 16–24); Damascus (= Bīt-Ḫazaʾili) (ii 25–[...]). The slab is part of a larger series that lists all of the major cities of countries annexed in the west. Moreover, this inscription belongs to a separate category of text, unparalleled elsewhere in Assyrian royal inscriptions. Tadmor referred to this text as Summary Inscription 5 (Summ. 5) in Tigl.

G. Smith copied the text from a squeeze then in the British Museum; the squeeze, now lost or destroyed, served as the basis for his copy in 3 R (pl. 10 no. 3). H. Rawlinson made a rough copy of the inscription (reproduced in Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. LII) and his draft deviates in several places from G. Smith’s published copy. P. Rost likewise made a copy of the text (Tigl. pl. XXVII) and it appears to be  more reliable than those of Smith and Rawlinson; the variants in ii 8 show that Rost must have utilized the same squeeze as G. Smith. With regard to the squeeze itself, it appears that it was damaged and mostly illegible in places, thus giving rise to the many conflicting readings of the signs. The present edition is based on the copy published in 3 R, but with improvements from the copies of Rawlinson and Rost.

Layard in the ruins of the South-West Palace at Kalḫu preserves eighteen lines of a summary inscription of Tiglath-pileser III. Layard noted in his field journal (MS A p. 68) that the “slab [was] much destroyed. Inscription across large figure with mace.” The text of this fragmentarily preserved inscription contains accounts of the following events: the delivery of tribute, possibly from a pharaoh of Egypt (name not preserved) to Kalḫu (734 or 733) (lines 1'–2'); the defeat of Samsi (733) (lines 3'–8'a); the submission of Arabian tribes (733–732) (lines 8'b–15'); the appointment of Idibiʾilu as the “gatekeeper facing Egypt” (734) (line 16'); and the partial annexation of Israel (733–732) (lines 17'–18'). Because the text is badly damaged and inscribed on a sculpted orthostat like the text of the Annals (Series C), there has been some debate among scholars whether this inscription belongs to the category of annals or summary inscriptions. As pointed out by H. Tadmor (Tigl. III pp. 198–199), comparison of the events in the west as recorded in Tiglath-pileser’s Kalḫu Annals and other summary inscriptions suggests that this text is indeed a summary inscription, although of a special category that contains a different and shorter version of the events of his reign.

Rawlinson’s draft copy, which begins with line 7, appears to have been made while the slab was  in situ , while he was at Nimrud in 1853–54, and therefore this copy is of primary importance.

This piece may be the only remnant of the slab that preceded the one that bore text no. 42; this is suggested by the fact that the fragments were copied on the same page in G. Smith’s notebook (Notebook 5 fol. 11r). The extant text contains a summary of events in Babylonia parallel to text no. 40 lines 6–10. Because text no. 41 is probably a duplicate of text no. 40 (see the introductions of these texts), it is not impossible that this fragment comes from the missing part of the slab inscribed with text no. 41. If this proves true, then this piece, which describes the subjugation of Aramean tribes, represents a passage now missing from the beginning of text no. 41; there is a one- or two-line lacuna between the last line of this text and the first line of text no. 41. It cannot be excluded, however, that the fragment is from another slab, one inscribed with a duplicate of text nos. 40 and 41.

Although the tablet is part of the British Museum’s Kuyunjik collection, it is quite probable that it was found at Kalḫu. The inscription does not belong to the family of summary inscriptions composed at the close of Tiglath-pileser’s reign. Since the description of events in the west does not yet include mention of Damascus, the text must antedate the Syrian campaigns of 734–732, thus being the earliest known summary inscription of Tiglath-pileser. The text, whose narration follows the usual geographical sequence (south, east, north, and west), contains the following: the king’s titles (lines 1–5a); the conquest of Aramean tribes beyond the Tigris and in northern Babylonia (745) (lines 5b–11); the conquest of Namri and Media (744, 737) (lines 12–16); the conquest of Ulluba and Naʾiri (739) (lines 17–19); the conquest of Bīt-Agusi and Unqi (740, 738) (lines 20–21); the conquest of north and central Syria (738) (lines 22–24); and the epilogue (lines 25–29).

When complete, the tablet would have measured about 5.5×10–12 cm.

The extant text represents about half of the original inscription. The size of the tablet appears to be similar in size to the one inscribed with text no. 49; however, the contents of this inscription are more detailed than that inscription. Composed in or shortly after Tiglath-pileser’s 17th  palû  (729) and written for his royal palace in Kalḫu (the Central Palace), as indicated by its building report, this text is the most detailed of Tiglath-pileser’s summary inscriptions. Sections, whose lengths vary in size, are separated by horizontal rulings. The inscription opens with the king’s titles (obv. 1–4), which are followed by a geographical summary of historical events, beginning with the south, and continuing with events in the east, north, and west. The preserved text contains descriptions of his campaigns to Babylonia (745, 731, 729) (obv. 5–28), Namri and Media (744, 737) (obv. 29–42), Ulluba and Ḫabḫu (739) (obv. 43–44), Urarṭu (743, 735) (obv. 45–50), and after a long gap, which must have dealt with campaigns to the west (partly covered by text no. 48), the defeat of Samsi (733–732) (rev. 1'–6'a). The historical portion concludes with a list of western rulers who brought tribute before the Assyrian king (rev. 6'b–13'). After this list, there are two additional reports of military activities: an engagement against Tabal (rev. 14'–15') and another against Tyre (rev. 16'), the outcome of both resulting in new kings ascending the throne and immediately paying a heavy tribute to Assyria. Since both of these events appear after the list of tributaries and after the framework of the text had been fixed, these campaigns must have taken place sometime after 732. The last preserved portion of text (lines 17'–36') contains the only complete building account of Tiglath-pileser from Kalḫu that has survived.

Smith marked its provenance, “S. E. Palace, Nimroud,” on the tablet. ND 400, a small fragment of a clay tablet also from Kalḫu, may come from the reverse face of this tablet. This may be so, but since it cannot be proved with certainty it is edited separately, as text no. 48; see the commentary to that inscription for further details.

Twenty-seven lines on one face of the tablet (probably the reverse) are preserved; the other face (probably the obverse) is completely broken away. The fragment appears to have come from a large tablet similar to the one inscribed with text no. 47, as suggested by the fact that both fragments appear to have been written by the same scribe (as noted by D.J. Wiseman and N. Naʾaman). The extant text contains descriptions of the subjugation of a city in Phoenicia (734 or 733) (lines 1'–9'; unparalleled in any other inscription); the punishment of a country, probably Israel (733–732) (lines 10'–14'a); the campaign against Ḫanūnu of Gaza and the erection of a stele near the Brook of Egypt (734) (lines 14'b–19'); the acknowledgment of Assyrian sovereignty by an Egyptian pharaoh (name not preserved) (734 or 733) (lines 20'–21'); the receipt of gifts from Siruatti the Meʾunite (734) (lines 22'–23'); and the campaign against Samsi (733) (lines 24'–27').

Wiseman (Iraq 13 [1951] pl. XI). It is possible that this tablet and the one inscribed with text no. 47 are both part of the same tablet, but without any direct physical join. Note that the last preserved line of this text (line 27'), which narrates the campaign against Samsi, is directly continued in the first line of the previous text (rev. 1'). Since it cannot be proven that the two pieces belong to the same tablet, it is best to edit them separately. It is also possible that the two tablets bear different copies of the same text, and that ND 400 supplies some of the text missing in K 3751 (text no. 47), in the long gap between the last line of its obverse and the first line of its reverse. The text was collated from the original, which is now in the British Museum, and from a photograph (Tadmor, Tigl. III pl. LVI).    The identification of the cities and countries mentioned in lines 1'–10'a and 10'b–14'a has been long disputed. A. Alt (Kleine Schriften 2 pp. 152–153) suggested that the city in question in lines 1'–10'a is Arvad, which is not mentioned among the conquests of 738 and whose king Mattan-biʾil (Mattan-Baʾal) does not appear in the lists of the western vassals in the Kalḫu Annals or in the Iran Stele (text no. 35). This view of Alt’s was followed by a number of scholars, including Tadmor in Tigl. III. However, it is more probable that this passage concerns Tyre, whose king, Hiram, cooperated with Raḫiānu (Rezin) of Damascus in 734, as described in text no. 49 rev. 5 (Ephʿal, Arabs p. 30; and Naʾaman, Tel Aviv 22/2 [1995] pp. 268–271). The country dealt with in lines 10'b–13' is to be identifed with Israel, Damascus, or Tyre. The lines do not contain any geographical or topographical data to point to a specific country. However, as Naʾaman (Tel Aviv 22/2 pp. 268–269) argues, the sequence of the episode in text no. 49 rev. 5–31 and this text + text no. 47 rev. 1'–16' seems to be more or less the same, i.e., Tyre, Israel, Philistia (Ashkelon and Gaza), the Arabs, and Egypt. This may support the identification of the two countries in question as Tyre and Israel.    Bibliography    1951 Wiseman, Iraq 13 pp. 21–24 and pl.

The beginning of the obverse and the end of the reverse are now missing, and the extant text contains descriptions of the following events: the defeat of Sarduri (743), the campaign to Urarṭu in which the Assyrians marched as far as Ṭurušpâ (735) (obv. 1'–5'); the conquest and annexation of Urarṭu (739, 736-735) — the conquest of Ulluba (obv. 6'–8'), the enlargement of the provinces of Aššur-iqīša (obv. 9'–10'), the chief steward (obv. 11'–13'), the chief cupbearer (obv. 14'–16'), the land Naʾiri (obv. 17'–19'), and the  turtānu  (obv. 20'–23'); the conquest of Bīt-Agusi (743–740) (obv. 24'–25'); the conquest of Unqi (740, 738) (obv. 26'–27'); the annexation of the north Syrian coast (738) (rev. 1–2); the conquest of Bīt-Hazaʾili (733–732) (rev. 3–4); the submission of Tyre (733–732) (rev. 5–8); the conquest of northern Israel (733–732) and the replacement of its king, Peqah, with Hoshea (731) (rev. 9–11); the forceful extraction of tribute from a king (of Ashkelon?) (rev. 12); the campaign against Ḫanūnu of Gaza and the submission of Gaza (734) (rev. 13–16); the defeat of Samsi (733) (rev. 17–22); the acknowledgment of Assyrian sovereignty by an unknown ruler, possibly an Egyptian pharaoh (734 or 733) (rev. 23–25); the receipt of tribute from Metenna of Tyre (730?) (rev. 26); the receipt of tribute from Ḫullî of Tabal (730 or 729?) (rev. 27–29); and the receipt of tribute, probably from some distant Arabian tribes (733–732) (rev. 30–31). Although the beginning of the inscription is missing, the text must have originally included an account concerning events in Babylonia and Media since the inscription follows a geographic pattern that is common to other summary inscriptions. Either text no. 51 or text no. 52 may represent that missing portion. Tadmor referred to this text as Summary Inscription 9 (Summ. 9) in Tigl. III.

In the traditional religious capital, Aššur, a stone block (text no. 54), which may originally have been a stele, was found in secondary context and several stamped and inscribed bricks recording work on the temples of the gods Aššur and Adad (text nos. 58–60) were discovered in the ruins of those buildings. At the entrances of the provincial city Ḫadattu (modern Arslan Tash), which Tiglath-pileser boasts of rebuilding, the king had colossal inscribed stone bulls erected as gateway guardians; the inscription on one of those bulls (text no. 53) survives today. Moreover, two stone duck weights, a bronze lion weight, and a stone bead (text nos. 61–64) bear proprietary labels of this king."

Thureau-Dangin and his team, who excavated the site on behalf of the Musée du Louvre. The inscription written on the right-flanking gateway figure is almost completely obliterated, but the text on the left-flanking bull is partially preserved. The text begins with Tiglath-pileser’s name and then goes on to narrate in first person his military achievements, including his victory over Aramean tribes in Babylonia (line 3) and his campaign against Samsi, queen of the Arabs (lines 16–17). The inscription then records construction at Ḫadattu. The building account, which begins with  ina u ₄- me-šú-ma  “at that time” (line 18), is also written in the first person (probably still the king, and not the governor, Ninurta-ilāya, who is mentioned in line 18). Despite statements in this text that Tiglath-pileser was actively involved in the work at Ḫadattu, the king appears to have entrusted the building to Ninurta-ilāya, a man who is perhaps to be identified with the governor of Naṣībīna who was eponym for the year 736 (Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 44 and 59).

Although almost nothing of the inscription is preserved on ex. 1*, the authors have tentatively included AO 11500 here because one expects that both bulls were inscribed with the same text. The surviving lines on ex. 1 were copied  in situ , transliterated, and translated by Thureau-Dangin. Tadmor (Tigl. III p. 205) made some improvements to Thureau-Dangin’s edition by collating the inscription from photographs. Note, however, that ex. 1 is erroneously indicated in Tadmor, Tigl. III as the right-flanking bull, instead of as the left-flanking one. Further minor improvements were made by Yamada when he collated the original in Paris (May, 2010).

The object, now housed in the Eşki Şark Eserleri Müzesi (Istanbul), may have originally been part of a provincial stele. Although the inscription is very fragmentarily preserved, it can be securely assigned to Tiglath-pileser III since it mentions Sulumal and Raḫiānu (biblical Rezin), who are known from the Kalḫu Annals as the kings of Melid (738) and Damascus (733) respectively.

Further minor corrections were made from the collation of Ass ph 2248. Many places where Nassouhi’s copy does not make any sense (e.g., lines 9, 11, 12, and 13) still remain unintelligible.

The epigraphs appear on orthostats inscribed with Annals Series A (Tadmor, Tigl. III pp. 241–248 fig. 11; see ibid. pp. 238–248 [Supplementary Study B] for a reconstruction of the hall of Series A). Interestingly, there does not seem to be any correlation between the scene depicted on the relief and the text of the Annals inscribed below on the same slab. Such captions accompanying pictorial narration on Assyrian palace reliefs are used for the first time in the reign of Tiglath-pileser III, although similar captions are found on the bronze door-bands of Shalmaneser III and on those of his father Ashurnasirpal II from Balawat (ancient Imgur-Enlil); see King, Bronze Reliefs; Schachner, Bilder eines Weltreichs; Barnett, Studies Böhl pp. 19–22; and Curtis and Tallis, The Balawat Gates of Ashurnasirpal II. Curiously, none of the cities in the three preserved captions are mentioned in any of Tiglath-pileser III’s Annal units from Kalḫu, or in any of his other inscriptions; this is not uncommon as several cities mentioned in epigraphs on the palace reliefs of Sargon II and Sennacherib are also not mentioned in their better-preserved annals (Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 98).         55  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/Q003468/]   A relief from Tiglath-pileser III’s palace at Kalḫu has a one-word epigraph that is placed just above the wall of a city, which is depicted as being situated on top of a mound or mountain and being attacked on all sides by Assyrian troops; Tadmor (Tigl. III pp. 243–244 fig. 11) places this orthostat in Annals Series A, Wall II. The scene, with its epigraph, appears in the upper register, above an inscription describing the events of the king’s 8th and 9th  palû s (text no. 28). This epigraph was edited as Misc.

The city shown on this relief is thought to be biblical Ashtaroth in Gilead, a city identified as Tell Astara in the northern Transjordan and which was probably part of the Assyrian province of Qarnini (Forrer, Provinz. p. 63; Oded, JNES 29 [1970] p. 179; Wäfler, Darstellungen pp. 118–124; and Radner, RLA 11/1–2 [2006] pp. 60–62 sub Qarnīna). The city’s capture is not mentioned elsewhere in the extant corpus of Tiglath-pileser III’s inscriptions, although the conquest of the nearby area, including Galʾadi (Gilead), is recorded in some non-annalistic inscriptions (text no. 42 line 6'; text no. 49 rev. 3; and text no. 50 rev. 3).

The relief and epigraph are known only from an original drawing, as the slab was left at Nimrud. Tadmor (Tigl. III pp. 247–248 fig. 11) places this orthostat in Annals Series A, Wall IV. The scene, with its epigraph, appears in the upper register, above an inscription recording events of the 15th  palû  (text nos. 23–24). The city mentioned in the caption is apparently biblical Gezer, located in the Vale of Ayalon. This city should not be regarded as the city Baʾil-Gazara, which is mentioned in an epigraph of Sargon II from Dūr-Šarrukīn and whose location remains unknown (Bagg, Rép. Géogr. 7/1 pp. 41–42; cf. Tadmor, Tigl. III p. 210). The conquest of Gezer is not mentioned elsewhere in the extant corpus of Tiglath-pileser III’s inscriptions. Nevertheless, like the city Ashtaroth, which is also known only from a caption (text no. 56), the city was probably captured in 733. This epigraph is referred to as Misc. II, 3 in Tadmor, Tigl.

This could, of course, be taken literally, in which case Tiglath-pileser would have been born toward the end of Adad-nārārī III’s reign since that Assyrian king ascended the throne in 811 and died in 783, after a twenty-eight-year reign. In this scenario, Tiglath-pileser would have been about forty or slightly older when he ascended the throne in 745 and about sixty when he died in 727. A fragmentary line in a royal edict, probably from the reign of Adad-nārārī III (Kataja and Whiting, SAA 12 no. 13 rev. 3), mentions a certain Tiglath-pileser ( m [GIŠ].⸢ tukul ⸣- ti -A- é-šár-ra ) who may have served in some official position at that time. If this individual is to be identified with Tiglath-pileser III, he would have to have been born earlier than stated above and thus he would have ascended the throne when he was much older, possibly when he was more than fifty years of age. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Tiglath-pileser was Adad-nārārī III’s grandson. In support of this proposal, the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary (SDAS) exemplar of the Assyrian King List (Gelb, JNES 13 [1964] p. 222; and Grayson, RLA 6/1–2 [1980] p. 115 §76) states that Tiglath-pileser was the son of his immediate predecessor, Aššur-nārārī V, and therefore the grandson of Adad-nārārī III. That version of the Assyrian King List, however, could contain a scribal error, where “son of Aššur-nārārī (V)” was written in lieu of “brother of Aššur-nārārī (V)” (Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 73; cf. Yamada, Studies H. and M. Tadmor p. 270*). Tadmor referred to this brick inscription as Misc. III, 1 in his Tigl. III.

III pp. 212–213) erroneously edited this inscription as a three-line text, rather than as a four-line inscription. The inclusion of the title “great king” (MAN GAL) in line 2 suggests that the text should be ascribed to Tiglath-pileser III, rather than to Tiglath-pileser I (Borger, EAK 1 p. 111).

Shortly after the discovery of this tomb, it was announced that the tomb belonged to Mullissu-mukannišat-Ninua, a ninth-century queen of Ashurnasirpal II and the mother of Shalmaneser III;  an  in situ  funerary inscription confirmed her identity. A. Fadhil published the short inscription on the duck weight as a text belonging to Tiglath-pileser III. The attribution to Tiglath-pileser III, however, is not entirely certain and thus the weight could belong to the second Assyrian king with this name, as suggested by the archaeological context of the find spot, i.e., in a ninth-century tomb.

The text is written on the duck’s back, to the left of the neck, together with an image of a lion etched just below. Similar images of lions appear on objects inscribed with texts of Sargon II and Esarhaddon and this might be evidence that this weight belonged to Tiglath-pileser III, not Tiglath-pileser II. Fifteen vertical strokes are incised on the opposite side of the neck, indicating that the object weighed “fifteen ( mina s).” The size of the weight remains unpublished and thus is unknown.

As noted by E. Frahm (AfO 44/45 [1997–98] p. 403), the name of Tiglath-pileser III is never written with GIŠ ( m GIŠ. tukul-ti -A- é-šár-ra ) in his known royal inscriptions. However, his name is written with GIŠ ( m GIŠ.TUKUL-A- é-šár-ra ) in a text of Yabâ, his queen (text no. 2004 line 2).

Because this label does not include a genealogy, it is uncertain as to which of the three Tiglath-pilesers this inscribed tile should be assigned. A.K. Grayson included the text in RIMA 2 (A.0.87.30) with the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser II, but without an edition since the object could not be located. With regard to the attribution, W. Andrae states: “Sie [the inscription] gibt keine Genealogie, ich schliesse, wie bereits auf S. 31 angedeutet, aus dem nahen Zusammensein der Fliesen Tukulti-Ninurtas II. und Asurnasirpals III. [sic!; for II] in einer und derselben Örtlichkeit, und aus der Stilähnlichkeit, dass hier Tiglatpileser III. (890–884) [sic!; the date given is for Tukulti-Ninurta II’s reign] vorliegt” (Andrae, FKA p. 32). He also says: “Die emaillierten sind zumeist von Asurnasirpal III. [sic!] Auch Tukulti-Ninurta II., sein Vater, und Tiglatpileser III. [sic!], sein Grossvater, haben diesen Schmuck an ihren Bauten anzubringen geliebt” (ibid. p. 31).  In these statements, Andrae apparently meant Ashurnasirpal II (883–859), Tukulti-Ninurta II (890–884), and Tiglath-pileser II (966–935). O. Pedersén, however, has assigned the text to Tiglath-pileser III, but without explanation. Although the inscription is probably not part of the Tiglath-pileser III corpus (following Andrae), the text is included here for the sake of completeness and convenience, i.e., because it was not edited in Grayson, RIMA 2 under Tiglath-pileser I or II.

The still unpublished text of the lions stationed in the East Gate reportedly states that Ninurta-bēlu-uṣur was a eunuch (LÚ.SAG) of the powerful  turtānu  Šamšī-ilu. Therefore, the inscriptions must roughly date to the first half of the eighth century (ca. 780–752), the period during which Šamšī-ilu held the office of eponym three times (780, 770, and 752, during the reigns of Shalmaneser IV, Aššur-dan III, and Aššur-nārārī V respectively). Thus, these inscriptions were possibly composed before Tiglath-pileser III became king in early 745. Since the Akkadian texts were not edited with the inscriptions of Shalmaneser IV, Aššur-dān III, or Aššur-nārārī V in Grayson, RIMA 3, they are arbitrarily treated here because Tiglath-pileser III had bull colossi placed in principal gateways of the city Ḫadattu (see text no. 53). The edition presented in this volume includes only the Akkadian text of the West Gate lions; the Akkadian inscription written on the East Gate lions is not edited here (see the commentary).

F. Thureau-Dangin  copied and edited the Akkadian text written on two of those fragments (Arslan-Tash pp. 85–89 and figs. 28–29 nos. 1–2). The third piece (no. 3), which is now lost, is reported to have preserved only the end of one line of an Akkadian inscription (“...  ia-ni ”), as well as traces of an Aramaic inscription (contents not recorded). The fourth fragment (no. 4) has fifteen lines of an Aramaic inscription; that text was written on the surface of the lion that abutted the wall next to which it was placed.     In the mid-1980s, the Syrian Directorate General for Antiquities and Museums brought additional fragments of two pairs of lion colossi from the West and East Gates of Arslan Tash (four statues in total) to the Aleppo Museum and the Museum of Raqqa. Two of these lions were reconstructed at the entrance of the city park of Raqqa (= Galter’s A2 and B2; see Galter, Studies Hunger p. 200 Abb. 5 and p. 206 Abb. 16). Utilizing all available fragments, H. Galter was able to establish feasible reconstructions for all four lions; for details on Galter’s sigla of lion fragments, see Studies Hunger, esp. p. 199 Abb. 4, p. 200 Abb. 5, p. 202 Abb. 8 and p. 206 Abb. 16. H. Galter, W. Röllig, and D. Hawkins have made great strides in our present understanding of these Akkadian, Aramaic and Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions.     The north lion of the West Gate (our ex. 2; = Galter’s B1; see Galter, Studies Hunger p. 202 fig. 8) is reconstructed from seven fragments. Some of the pieces are now in the Aleppo Museum (Galter’s B1.3–6; B1.3 = Thureau-Dangin’s no. 2), while others are in the Museum of Raqqa (Galter’s B1.1–2 and 7); one fragment (Galter’s B1.8 = Thureau-Dangin’s no. 3) is now lost. The south lion of the West Gate (our ex. 1; = Galter’s B2) is reconstructed from several fragments; those pieces are now included in a reconstructed sculpture in the northern entrance of the city park of Raqqa. Four other fragments of the south lion are in the Aleppo Museum and in the Museum of Raqqa (Galter’s B2.1–4; B2.2 = Thureau-Dangin’s no. 1). Both of the West Gate lions are inscribed with a bilingual Akkadian-Aramaic text, with the two versions placed side by side. This pair of colossi does not bear Hieroglyphic Luwian texts, unlike their counterparts in the East Gate.     The middle parts of seven lines are preserved on ex. 1. The interline measurement is said to be 4–5 cm on average. Ex. 2 (= Galter’s B1.1+2 and B1.3) preserves the first parts of nine lines, all of which are inscribed on the surface of the lion that abutted the wall next to which it was placed. The transliteration of ex. 1 is based on F. Thureau-Dangin’s copy, which he made from a squeeze (Thureau-Dangin, Arslan-Tash p. 85 fig. 28; reproduced in Galter, Studies Hunger p. 209). The transliteration of ex. 2 is based on Röllig’s copy (Studies Parpola p. 277), as well as on his score edition and detailed commentary. Only the Akkadian text is edited here and the edition more or less follows that of Röllig since the text was not collated from the originals. The master text is a conflation of exs. 1 and 2. A score is presented at the back of the book (p. 191). For a copy and edition of the Aramaic text written on these two lions, see Röllig, Studies Parpola pp. 272–278.    The south lion of the East Gate (= Galter’s A2), now in the northern entrance of the city park of Raqqa, bears a legible nine-line Akkadian inscription, as well as a nine-line Aramaic text and a four-line Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription. All three texts are written on the colossus’ wall-facing surface. According to Galter (AOAT 318 pp. 175–176; and Melammu 5 pp. 449–450), the Akkadian inscription records that Ninurta-bēlu-uṣur constructed Ḫadattu’s wall and gates, in which the lion colossi were stationed. That inscription not only calls him governor ( bēl pīḫāti ) of Kār-Shalmaneser, but also a eunuch (LÚ.GAL) of Šamšī-ilu. The text concludes with a curse against any ruler who damages this governor’s inscription. The contents of the Aramaic text are said to more or less duplicate those of the Akkadian text. The Luwian inscription (Hawkins, CHLI 1/1 pp. 246–248, and 1/3 pls. 103–105), however, has different content. Photographs of the Akkadian inscription have been published by Galter (Melammu 5 p. 449 fig. 6) and Hawkins (CHLI 1/3 pls. 103 bottom and 105), but they are not sufficiently legible to provide a reliable edition of the whole text and therefore no edition of it is included here. This lion is also excluded from the catalogue as it cannot be confirmed that its Akkadian text is a duplicate of exs. 1 and 2.     The north lion of the East Gate (= Galter’s A1), now in the courtyard of the Archaeological Museum of Aleppo, is reported to bear the same texts as the south lion of the East Gate (= Galter’s A2). All three texts are written on the wall-facing surface and are said to be in worse condition than those written on the south lion. No edition, copy, or photograph of the Akkadian inscription has been published and therefore no edition of that text is included here. Moreover, this lion is excluded from the catalogue as the authors cannot confirm that this lion’s Akkadian text is a duplicate of the one inscribed on the West Gate lions.

Several objects with inscriptions of Assyrian queens from the second half of the eighth century, as well as several other inscribed articles, were found in that tomb (Tomb II). The treasures of this sensational find included: three items belonging to Yabâ, queen of Tiglath-pileser III (a stone funerary tablet and two gold bowls); two objects belonging to Bānītu (or Banītu), queen of Shalmaneser V (a gold bowl and an electrum cosmetic container); three items belonging to Atalia, queen of Sargon II (a gold bowl, a crystal jar, and an electrum mirror); a duck weight, a cylinder seal, and at least eight beads, two of which bear short labels of the Babylonian kings Kurigalzu and Marduk-zākir-šumi. The inscriptions on the five items belonging to the queens of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V are edited in the present volume as Tiglath-pileser III nos. 2003–2005 and Shalmaneser V nos. 2001–2002. For new editions of all of the Tomb II inscriptions, see al-Rawi, New Light on Nimrud pp. 119–138.    As pointed out by A.R. George, the name of Atalia and possibly that of Yabâ are northwest Semitic, suggesting that these two ladies “were thus probably of Syrian or Levantine birth, entering the Assyrian harem as a result of diplomatic marriages or as spoils of the many western campaigns undertaken by the Assyrian armies of this period” (Minerva 1/1 [1990] p. 31). S. Dalley believes that Yabâ and Atalia were princesses from Jerusalem (SAAB 12/2 [1998] pp. 83–98); however, see the reservations of Younger Jr. (VT 52/2 [2002] pp. 207–218) on this matter. Moreover, Dalley (New Light on Nimrud pp. 171–175; and JSOT 28 [2004] pp. 387–401) has recently suggested that Banītu (an alternative interpretation of the name Bānītu) is an Akkadian translation of West-Semitic Yabâ (meaning “beautiful”) and that Yabâ and Banītu (that is, Bānītu) are one and the same person. This would imply that Yabâ maintained her pre-eminent rank in the harem after the death of Tiglath-pileser III, during the reign of Shalmaneser V.          2003  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/Q003619/]   A stone funerary tablet of queen Yabâ was discovered in a side niche of the antechamber of a tomb hidden in the North-West Palace at Kalḫu, under the pavement of Room 49. The tablet has fourteen lines inscribed on its obverse and eight lines on its reverse, for a total of twenty-two lines of text. The inscription states that Yabâ died a natural death and curses anyone who might place someone else in her tomb or remove her from her final resting place. Yabâ is designated only as “queen,” MUNUS.É.GAL (probably read as  šēgallu / sēgallu ; see Parpola, SAAB 2/2 [1988] pp. 73–76, and Borger, MZ pp. 346–348); note that the two other inscriptions of hers, those written on bowls (text nos. 2004–2005), state that she was the queen and wife of Tiglath-pileser. Despite Yabâ’s warning, a later queen reused her tomb and sarcophagus; excavators found the bodies of two women in Yabâ’s sarcophagus. It has been suggested that the bodies are those of Yabâ and Atalia (Sargon II’s wife), and that the latter was buried with the former and with the property of Bānītu (Shalmaneser V’s wife), family heirlooms that she inherited (Kamil in Damerji, Gräber pp. 12–13). An alternative view is to regard the bodies as those of Bānītu and Atalia (George, Minerva 1/1 [1990] p. 31). However, if one regards Banītu (that is, Bānītu) and Yabâ as one and the same lady (see the general introduction to text nos. 2003–2005), with the name Banītu being an Akkadian translation of the West-Semitic name Yabâ (not necessarily Hebrew), then this explains why only two bodies were found in this tomb.

The rim of the bowl bears a similar inscription to text no. 2004, but without her designation as “wife” (Akk.  altu ). Since the original was not available for study, the present edition is based on the published copies and editions of Kamil and al-Rawi, with the help of published photographs.

The provenance of the object is not known. Only the left side of the inscribed face remains and the edges of that face have been sawn and rounded to give the appearance that the brick is complete; the back and right side of the brick are broken away. The inclusion of the title  šar mātāti  [ šarḫi ? ] “[ magnificent ] king of the lands” (line 2) might suggest that the king to whom this brick was dedicated was more likely Tiglath-pileser III, rather than one of the two earlier by the same name, since that royal title is first attested for Ashurnasirpal II (883–859). Because the attribution to Tiglath-pileser III cannot be confirmed, the text is included here arbitrarily.

Layard discovered sixteen bronze weights of various sizes in the shape of crouching lions under one of the colossal winged bulls flanking Entrance b of the throne room (Chamber B) of the North-West Palace at Kalḫu (Nimrud). Thirteen are inscribed with Akkadian inscriptions and nine of these bear inscriptions of a Shalmaneser. Since the weights were discovered with weights of Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, and Sennacherib, the Shalmaneser to whom these lions belong must be the fifth Assyrian king of that name.          1  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/Q003622/]    A weight in the shape of a lion discovered at Kalḫu is inscribed with a short Akkadian text stating that the object belonged to Shalmaneser (V) and weighed five  mina s, a weight authorized by the king (“ mina  of the king”).

Johns (ADD 2/1 p. 261 Leo 11), Weissbach (ZDMG 61 [1907] p. 401 no. 69), Lehmann-Haupt (ZDMG 66 [1912] pp. 682, 685 and 687), and Braun-Holzinger (Bronzen p. 111) assigned the weight to Sargon II, while Mitchell (in Gyselen, Prix p. 134 no. 10) and Tadmor (Tigl. III pp. 316–317) assigned it to Tiglath-pileser III. T.C. Mitchell’s reading of the name as Tiglath-pileser (III) was followed by Tadmor, with some minor modifications. F.M. Fales (Studies Lipiński pp. 41–42 no. 8) identified it as a text belonging to Shalmaneser V (following Pinches; see de Vogüé, CIS 2/1 pp. 9–10 no. 9). An unpublished memo of Tadmor (recording further collation) follows Fales’ reading. J. Novotny collated the inscription and the results of his collation confirm the assignment of this weight to Shalmaneser V.     As already noted in previous studies, the style of the Akkadian text differs from that of the other weights by referring to the weight first and then to the name of its owner. Moreover, this  lion weight is the only one of the nine weights assigned to Shalmaneser V that uses the light standard.    This bronze lion weight, which never had a handle attached to it, weighs 480.149g. Previous publications have often confused the weight of this object (BM 91227) with that of BM 91229, a bronze lion weight of Sargon II. The two pieces were weighed at the request of G. Frame in the British Museum (personal communication), and BM 91227 is the one weighing 480.149g (and BM 91229 is the one weighing 468.388g), as correctly pointed out by Mitchell (contra Fales).     The Akkadian inscription is written on the lion’s back. The Aramaic inscription is incised on the bottom. One vertical stroke, apparently indicating the weight of one (light)  mina , is inscribed in the middle of the Akkadian inscription, in line 2 just before the LUGAL sign. The present edition is based on F.M. Fales’ published copy (Studies Lipiński p. 41) and the collation notes of J. Novotny.

The stamp impressions depict a left-facing crouching lion on a base and a handle extending from the back of the lion’s neck to its lower back. A three-line Akkadian inscription on its torso states that the weight belonged to an Assyrian king (name damaged) and weighs one  mina , and a one-line Aramaic inscription on the base also records the weight of the lion. Because the image (with its inscriptions) closely resembles the bronze lion weights discovered by A.H. Layard in the North-West Palace at Nimrud (see the introduction to Shalmaneser V text no. 1–9 and figs. 11–12), these clay disks may have belonged to one of the kings whose name is inscribed on those weights: Tiglath-pileser III, Shalmaneser V, Sargon II, or Sennacherib. Since the royal name begins with both the masculine personal determinative ( m ) and the divine determinative ( d ), Shalmaneser V (as suggested by H. Galter and B. Scholz) or Sennacherib are the most likely candidates; however, other later Sargonid kings, including Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, cannot be excluded.

Because the objects are much lighter than one  mina  (ca. 500g), it seems unlikely that the disks were actually used as weights; ex. 1 (complete) weighs only 296g and ex. 2 (damaged) weighs just 158g. Moreover, these clay disks do not appear to be dockets since they are not perforated. They may have been used as covers for containers that stored one  mina  of goods. Because the objects were not collated from the originals in the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Vienna), the edition is based on the photographs published by H. Galter and B. Scholz (AfO 35 [1988] p. 32 fig. 4 and p. 34 fig. 5). The authors, however, regard the alphabetic inscription as Aramaic, rather than Hebrew as suggested by Galter and Scholz.

The bodies of two ladies were found in the sarcophagus, but with objects bearing the names of three queens: Yabâ, Bānītu, and Atalia (queen of Sargon II). The tomb, however, must have originally belonged to Yabâ, queen of Tiglath-pileser III, as a funerary tablet of hers found in the antechamber of the tomb suggests (see Tiglath-pileser text no. 2003). If the bodies are those of Yabâ and Atalia, as proposed by Damerji and Kamil, the objects belonging to Bānītu may have been buried with Atalia as family heirlooms. Alternatively, as S. Dalley (New Light on Nimrud pp. 171–175; and JSOT 28 [2004] pp. 387–401) has suggested, one could consider that Banītu (an alternative interpretation of the name Bānītu) is an Akkadian translation of West-Semitic Yabâ (meaning “beautiful”) and that Yabâ and Banītu (that is, Bānītu) are one and the same person. This would imply that Yabâ maintained her pre-eminent rank in the harem after Tiglath-pileser III died and was succeeded by Shalmaneser V.     This inscription of Bānītu, which basically parallels the one inscribed on a cosmetic container (Shalmaneser V text no. 2002), contains only her name and the title “queen of Shalmaneser (V).” Since the original was not available for study, the edition is based on the published copies and editions of Kamil and al-Rawi.

The text is a near duplicate of Shalmaneser V text no. 2001, which is inscribed on a gold bowl. Because the original was not available for study, the edition is based on the published copies and editions of Kamil and al-Rawi.
