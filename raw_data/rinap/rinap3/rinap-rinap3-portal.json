      "text": "Amid the tragedy of Sargon II's death, Sennacherib (Akk.  Sîn-aḫḫē-erība , \"The god Sin has replaced the brothers\") took control of Assyria and Babylonia, and immediately made Nineveh his capital. He was well suited for the task, as he had performed numerous important military and administrative duties while his father was king. Sennacherib's training served him well during his twenty-four-year reign, both at home and on the battlefield. He personally led the Assyrian army into battle no fewer than ten times and sponsored many large-scale building projects. One of his greatest achievements was the transformation of Nineveh into the premier Assyrian city, with a magnificent palace, a large and well-equipped armory, imposing inner and outer city walls, a royal road, and exotic and well-stocked botanical gardens and game parks.    He accompanied and sent his armies on far-flung campaigns in every direction. To the north, Sennacherib defeated the inhabitants of cities located near and on Mount Nipur (modern Judi Dagh) and the defiant ruler of the city Ukku. To the northwest, where his father had been killed, Assyrian officials led campaigns against anti-Assyrian rulers. To the west, Sennacherib personally led his armies along the Mediterranean coast. Some rulers submitted without a fight, but others, including Hezekiah of Judah, fought back with support from Egypt and Nubia. The Assyrians defeated Egyptian and Nubian auxiliary forces, returned the pro-Assyrian ruler of the city Ekron to his throne, captured forty-six Judean cities (including Lachish), and laid siege to the city Jerusalem; this event is also described in the Bible (2 Kings 18:13-19:36 and 2 Chronicles 32:1-22).  The defenses of the Judean capital held firm, but Hezekiah, whom the Assyrians confined \"like a bird in a cage,\" was forced to strike a costly deal with Sennacherib before the siege was lifted; the bribe worked, as Hezekiah was permitted to remain in power. Later in his reign, the Assyrian army marched into the Arabian desert and captured the city Adummatu.    Throughout his reign, Sennacherib wrestled with the problem of ruling southern Mesopotamia, and attempted various solutions, none of which worked. He undertook military action against Babylonia and Elam no fewer than six times. By 693 BC, Sennacherib was completely fed up with Babylon, especially after the king of Elam had carried off into exile his eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi, whom he had appointed king of Babylon. In 691 BC, the Assyrians fought a heated battle against the Babylonians and Elamites at the city Ḫalule. After suffering a setback, Sennacherib made his way to Babylon and besieged that city. Babylon held out for fifteen months before falling to the Assyrians. Sennacherib plundered and destroyed the city and its temples; the city's tutelary deity Marduk was smashed or carried off to the city Aššur. According to several texts, Babylon was left \"kingless.\"    Late in his reign, Sennacherib nominated Esarhaddon, a younger son of his, as his successor. That decision, however, was not universally accepted by his family and Esarhaddon was forced into exile. In late 681 BC, Sennacherib was murdered in Nineveh, possibly between bull colossi in one of its temples; his son Urdu-Mullissu appears to have been one of the chief conspirators. With their father dead and the designated successor in exile, Sennacherib's sons and their supporters vied for control of Assyria.     Further reading    E.

      "text": "The present series of publications, Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP), is intended to present up-to-date editions of the royal inscriptions of a number of Neo-Assyrian rulers. It is modeled on the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) series and will carry on where its RIMA (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods) publications ended. The RIM Project was initiated by A. Kirk Grayson at the University of Toronto in 1979 and over the years received extensive support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff. In all, it produced ten volumes in its various sub-series. Grayson retired from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a few years later found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits due to personal and family illnesses. At that time, he handed over responsibility for the work of the project to me, formerly the assistant director and at times acting director of the RIM Project. When I took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and the last RIM volume (RIME 1 by Douglas R. Frayne) appeared in early 2008, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist. Work on several further volumes of inscriptions of Assyrian and Babylonian rulers had already begun during the time of the RIM Project and Grayson passed on responsibility for the materials and manuscripts to me. In 2007, I initiated the current project in order to continue the task of making the official inscriptions of the several important Neo-Assyrian rulers available in up-to-date, scholarly editions. While the volumes in the new series will resemble the format of the RIM volumes in most matters, the RINAP volumes will include indices of proper names, and editions of the texts will also be available online, in connection with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI).     Two volumes have already appeared in this series: RINAP 1, comprising the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V (begun by Hayim Tadmor and completed by his collaborator Shigeo Yamada), and RINAP 4, comprising the inscriptions of Esarhaddon (by Erle Leichty, with a contribution by Grant Frame). The royal inscriptions of Sennacherib will be presented in two parts, with the present volume being the first part (RINAP 3/1, by A. Kirk Grayson and Jamie Novotny); part two, also by Grayson and Novotny, is scheduled to appear in 2014. With the collaboration of Andreas Fuchs for two texts, I am preparing RINAP 2, the inscriptions of Sargon II. In addition, Jamie Novotny and Greta Van Buylaere are currently carrying out work on the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal and his successors Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarra-iškun.     The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the RINAP Project research grants in 2008, 2010, and 2012 to help carry out its work and my thanks must be expressed to it. My appreciation must also be extended to the University of Pennsylvania, where the project is based in the Babylonian Section of its Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.      Philadelphia, June 2012   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "The preparation of this book has taken far longer than expected partly because the number of inscriptions of Sennacherib has continued to increase at a pace commensurate with the passing of the decades since the inception of the project. The delay was compounded by the unexpected closure of the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project resulting in a long period when no research was done at all. Grant Frame, with the encouragement of Erle Leichty, rescued the Sennacherib project in 2007 when he founded the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project at the University of Pennsylvania with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The authors are extremely grateful to Professors Frame and Leichty for their initiative.      While Kirk Grayson has been involved in research on Sennacherib since his graduate student days in the 1950s, active work on preparing the corpus of the complete royal inscriptions of this king only began in earnest under the auspices of the RIM Project in the 1980s. Lynne George and Hannes Galter, student assistants on the Project, began the systematic preparation of preliminary transliterations and bibliographies of some of the texts. When Grayson had completed RIMA 3, he personally took over work on the Sennacherib project in the mid-1990s and continued in that capacity until 2003 when family and illness forced him to stop. During that time, Grayson did the bulk of the research and collation of the texts of Sennacherib that were inscribed on clay cylinders, clay prisms, clay and stone tablets, stone horizontal prisms, and stone bull and lion colossi, preparing the transliterations, translations, scores, catalogues, introductions, commentaries, and bibliographies. In 2003, Grayson found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits and thus work on the Sennacherib volumes was put on hold.      In 2008, when the last RIM volume appeared, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist and the fate of the Sennacherib inscriptions was in limbo. Grant Frame, however, was given responsibility for the materials and manuscripts. In 2008–2009, Matthew Rutz, the Project’s postdoctoral researcher, organized the numerous paper and electronic files, carefully assessed the material, especially the inscriptions from Aššur, made some preliminary notes on what work needed to be carried out, and collated several clay cylinders and prisms in the British Museum (London).      After Rutz took up a position at Brown University in 2009, Jamie Novotny took over responsibility for the Sennacherib texts.  He reorganized and standardized the contents of the book, prepared the front and back material, collated further texts in the British Museum (London) and Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), wrote the book’s introduction and most of the on-page notes, updated and expanded the existing commentaries and bibliographies, and finalized the editions and scores.      Work on the present corpus of texts necessitated extensive travel for collation of previously published inscriptions and for examination of unpublished material. The authors wish to thank the various museums and museum authorities that have cooperated in the preparation of this book. First, they would like to thank the directors, keepers, curators, and assistants of the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Chicago), British Museum (London), Yale Babylonian Collection (New Haven), and Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York). Specifically, the authors express their gratitude to John Curtis, Walter Farber, Irving Finkel, Joachim Marzahn, Jonathan Taylor, and Christopher Walker. These individuals, and their staff, have been extremely helpful and have extended to us every courtesy and assistance. Secondly, they would like to thank the Trustees of the British Museum and the Vorderasiatisches Museum for allowing the RINAP Poject to publish photographs of objects bearing Sennacherib inscriptions, and the British Institute for the Study of Iraq for giving permission to reproduce plans published in the journal Iraq.      As usual with a volume in this series,  numerous individuals aided in the production of the volume in some way. Since the preparation of this book has spanned more than two decades, it is impossible to name everyone who has contributed to RINAP 3/1 and thus any omissions is unintentional.  While the authors have collated most of the texts themselves, other scholars have kindly collated some texts, provided information on pieces, or aided in some way. These include Jeremy Black, Eckart Frahm, Grant Frame, Douglas Frayne, Renee Gallery, Hannes Galter, Lynne George, Amir Harrak, Mikko Luukko, Alan Millard, John Russell, Julian Reade, Karen Radner, Matthew Rutz, Edmond Sollberger, David Stronach, and Christopher Walker.      In Toronto, during the RIM years, and later in Philadelphia, several individuals contributed to the technical preparation of the volume and they deserve credit for performing tedious and time-consuming tasks.  For the Toronto stage of production, the authors offer their gratitude to Lynne George and Hannes Galter for preparing and entering the preliminary transliterations of some of the inscriptions, and to Hope Grau and Jill Ruby for performing various other tasks. For the Philadelphia stage of production, the authors would like to thank the postdoctoral researchers and student assistants who helped in the completion of the volume: Hezekiah Akiva Bacovcin, Matthew Rutz, Irene Sibbing Plantholt, Zackary Wainer, and especially Andrew Knapp. Last, but by no means least, special thanks must be given to Steve Tinney for undertaking the arduous task of generating the final camera-ready copy and converting and preparing the texts for the online version.      The penultimate manuscript was read by Nicholas Postgate, Greta Van Buylaere, and Martin Worthington, all of whom made numerous astute comments, welcome criticisms, and improvements, particularly on the transliterations and translations. In addition to providing valuable feedback, Martin Worthington kindly provided the RINAP Project with a near complete draft of his unpublished book Principles of Akkadian Textual Criticism. In addition, members of the RINAP editorial board and the project consultants offered helpful suggestions at various times near the completion of the volume. Their time, care, and generosity are greatly appreciated.      Wilfred Lambert, to whom this book is dedicated, had been asked to serve as a reader, but sadly passed away prior to reviewing the manuscript. Lambert served as a reader for all ten RIM volumes and the first two published RINAP volumes (RINAP 1 and RINAP 4). His critical feedback, which stemmed from his vast knowledge of Mesopotamian texts (published and unpublished) and secondary literature, always improved the books immensely.  The authors would like to acknowledge here their gratitude to Wilfred Lambert not only for his time, service, and generosity to both the RIM and RINAP Projects, but also for his numerous contributions to the field of Assyriology.      The authors’ appreciation goes out once again to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania, and several private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff and Malcolm Horsnell, whose financial support allowed for their travel to the numerous museums cited above and provided the funding necessary for them to conduct the research in Sennacherib’s inscriptions and to publish this volume.      Last, but by no means least, the authors wish to record their gratitude for the ongoing support and encouragement of their families: Eunice Grayson†, Vera and Sally Grayson, and six grandchildren; Denise Bolton, Robert and Diana Novotny, and Jennifer Novotny.      Toronto and Philadelphia, June  2012   A. Kirk Grayson   Jamie Novotny"

      "text": "The volumes in the RINAP series are modeled upon the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project, with a few modifications, in particular the addition of indices of proper names. Like the RIM volumes, the volumes in this series are not intended to provide analytical or synthetic studies, but rather to provide basic text editions that can serve as the foundations for such studies. Thus, extensive discussions of the contents of the texts are not presented, and the core of each volume is the edition of the relevant texts.    In this volume, the order of the texts is based for the most part upon the following two criteria:   (1) The city at which the structure dealt with in the building or dedicatory portion of the text was located. If that information is not preserved on the text, the provenance of the inscribed object is the determining factor.    (2) The type of object upon which the inscription is written (prism, cylinder, tablet, etc.).     Following the practice of the RIM series, inscriptions that cannot be assigned definitely to a particular ruler are given text numbers beginning at 1001. Certain other inscriptions that provide information relevant for establishing royal names and titles (e.g. “servant seals”) and any composed in the name of another member of the royal family (e.g., royal wives) have been given numbers that begin at 2001.   In the volumes of the RINAP series, the term “exemplar” is employed to designate a single inscription found on one object. The term “text” is employed to refer to an inscription that existed in antiquity and that may be represented by a number of more or less duplicate exemplars. In these editions exemplars of one text are edited together as a “master text,” with a single transliteration and translation. Variants to the “master text” are provided either on page (major variants) or at the back of the volume (minor variants).    Each text edition is normally supplied with a brief introduction containing general information. This is followed by a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars. This includes museum and excavation numbers (the symbol + is added between fragments that belong to the same object), provenance, dimensions of the object, lines preserved, and indication of whether or not the inscription has been collated (c = collated with the original, p = collated by means of a photograph, (p) = partially collated from a photograph; and n = not collated). The next section is normally a commentary containing further technical information and notes. The bibliography then follows. Items are arranged chronologically, earliest to latest, with notes in parentheses after each item. These notes indicate the exemplars with which the item is concerned and the nature of the publication, using the following key words: provenance, photo, copy, edition, translation, catalogue, and study. Certain standard reference works (e.g., the various volumes of “Keilschriftbibliographie” and “Register Assyriologie” published in Orientalia and Archiv für Orientforschung respectively; Borger, HKL 1–3; AHw; CAD; and Seux, ERAS) are not normally cited, although they were essential in the collecting and editing of these texts. While the bibliographies should contain all major relevant items, they are not necessarily totally exhaustive; a vast amount of scattered literature exists on many of the inscriptions edited in this volume and much of this literature is of only limited scholarly interest.   As noted earlier, a distinction is made between major and minor variants to a “master text”; the major variants are placed at the bottom of the page and the minor variants at the back of the book. In brief, major variants are essentially non-orthographic in nature, while minor variants are orthographic variations. Orthographic variants of proper names may at times be significant and thus on occasion these will also appear on the page as major variants. Complete transliterations of all exemplars in the style of musical scores are found on the CD-ROMs accompanying the volumes and thus any reader who finds the notes on variants insufficient for his/her needs may check the full reading of any exemplar. Such scores, however, are not normally given for bricks and seal inscriptions. Objects whose attribution to a particular text is not entirely certain are given exemplar numbers that are followed by an asterisk (*); for example, BM 134584 is regarded as text no. 1 ex. 1*, since it is uncertain that it is a duplicate of BM 113203 (text no. 1 ex. 1). Moreover, these exemplars are listed in separate catalogues (Catalogue of Uncertain Exemplars), beneath the main catalogue.    Seven photographs are included in this volume. The selection includes the best preserved inscriptions on clay cylinders and clay prisms, as well as a stele from Sennacherib’s royal road and a fragmentary stone tablet. The photographs are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to show a few of the object types upon which Sennacherib’s inscriptions were written.    As is the normal practice for transliterating cuneiform inscriptions, lower case Roman is used for Sumerian and lower case italics for Akkadian; logograms in Akkadian texts appear in capitals. The system of sign values in Borger, Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon, is generally followed. Italics in the English translation indicate either an uncertain translation or a word in the original language. In general, the rendering of personal names follows the PNA; however, the names of Babylonian rulers follow the spelling used in RIMB 2.    There are several differences between the RIM and RINAP styles. Among these, the most notable is that all partially preserved or damaged signs, regardless of how they are broken, now appear between half brackets (⌜ and ⌝). Thus, no partially preserved sign has square brackets ([ and ]) inserted in its transliteration; for example, [DINGI]R and LUGA[L KU]R appear in the transliteration as ˹DINGIR˺ and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ respectively. This change was made to ensure compatibility of the online RINAP editions with the standards of the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), the parent site and project where RINAP Online is housed. This change was implemented in the print version in order to present identical editions in RINAP 1 and RINAP Online. Note, however, that the translations may appear more damaged than their corresponding transliterations indicate, as the translations were prepared according to standard Assyriological practices; for example, ˹DINGIR˺ (= [DINGI]R) and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ (= LUGA[L KU]R) are translated as “[the go]d” and “king [of the lan]d,” and not “the god” and “king of the land.”   In addition to the indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications found in RIM volumes, the RINAP volumes also contain indices of proper names (personal names, topographical names and divine names). Online versions of the manuscripts are maintained by CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative) and are fully searchable.    Philadelphia, June 2012   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "In 705, Sargon II was killed in battle and his body was never recovered. Amid the tragedy and apparently without opposition, his eldest living son and designated successor ascended the throne of Assyria on the twelfth of Abu (V). [1]  Sennacherib, whose name means “The god Sîn has replaced the brothers” (Akk.  Sîn-aḫḫē-erība ) and who was about forty years old at the time, was well suited for the task, as his father Sargon had conferred on him numerous important military and administrative duties soon after he had become king in 722. [2]  His on-the-job training, which may have been supervised by a man called Ḫunnî, served him well during his twenty-four-year reign (704–681), both at home and on the battlefield. He personally led the Assyrian army on campaign no fewer than ten times and sponsored large-scale building projects in several Assyrian cities, Aššur, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu in particular. His name and deeds, as recorded in his own words, as well as in later foreign sources, were never forgotten; Sennacherib was remembered long after his death for besieging the Judean capital Jerusalem, an event described in the Bible (2 Kings 18:13–19:36 and 2 Chronicles 32:1–22) and for destroying Babylon and its revered temples. [3]  His fame (or infamy) revived when European explorers began uncovering the ruins of Assyrian royal cities in the mid-nineteenth century. Of the late Neo-Assyrian kings mentioned in the Bible and classical sources, Sennacherib is probably the best known.     Sources for Sennacherib’s reign are both abundant and informative. Royal inscriptions provide the bulk of the information about his successes both on the battlefield and at home, where he sponsored major building enterprises. Royal rhetoric, which does not always accurately record historical reality, is supplemented by chronographic texts (the so-called Babylonian Chronicle and Eponym Chronicle), letters, astrological reports, legal and administrative documents, and grants, as well as by numerous bas reliefs sculpted on orthostats that lined the interior walls of his ornately decorated palace at Nineveh. The Bible and some classical sources (e.g., Berossus,  Babyloniaca ; Herodotus,  Hist. ; and Josephus,  Ant. Jud. ) also provide insight into his reign.        Notes      1  The fact that the Assyrians were not able to recover Sargon’s body and that Sennacherib was not able to hold a funeral for his father as tradition prescribed was regarded as highly inauspicious. The so-called “Sin of Sargon” text (Livingstone, SAA 3 no. 33), probably written during the reign of Sennacherib’s immediate successor Esarhaddon, reports that Sennacherib investigated the nature of his father’s alleged sin; for a recent study, see Weaver, Iraq 66 (2004) pp. 61–66. E. Frahm (JCS 51 [1999] pp. 73–90) has suggested that the Assyrian scholar Nabû-zuqup-kēnu may have studied the passage about the spirits of the deceased in Gilgamesh Tablet XII in order to elucidate the consequences of Sargon II’s death. He proposes also that Sennacherib immediately transferred the royal court to Nineveh since the newly enthroned king may have feared that his father’s unburied ghost was still present at Dūr-Šarrukīn (mod. Khorsabad) and that his renovations of the temple of the god Nergal at Tarbiṣu at the very beginning of his reign were inspired by Sargon’s ill fate.       2  For information on Sennacherib’s name, his family background, and his responsibilities during his father’s reign (including the relevant source material), see in particular Frahm, PNA 3/1 pp. 1113–1118 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība I–II.3b-1'; and Frahm, RLA 12/1–2 (2009) pp. 12–14 §§1–4. The name Sîn-aḫḫē-erība implies that he was not Sargon II’s firstborn son; his elder brothers, it appears, had all died by the time of his birth. Because his eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi was old enough to become king of Babylon in 700, S. Parpola (LAS 2 p. 231 n. 390) and E. Frahm (PNA 3/1 p. 1113 I.1) suggest that Sennacherib was born around 745. The identity of Sennacherib’s mother is unknown, but it has been suggested that she may have been Sargon’s wife Atalia.    Sennacherib’s name appears as  snḥr ( y ) b  in the Bible (2 Kings 18:13 and 19:20);  s / šnḥ ( ʾ ) r ( y ) b  in Aramaic sources (including Ahiqar); Σεν(ν)αχηριμ in the Septuagint; Σαναχαριβοϛ in Herodotus ( Hist.  2, 141); and  Wsḫ-rn=f  in Demotic sources. For other Greek and Latin forms of his name, see Weissbach in Wissowa, Paulys Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Zweite Reihe 1/2 col. 2271; that publication does not collect the many different writings of the name which derive from Hebrew and Greek transcriptions of Sennacherib. A document from Nineveh written ca. 670 (83-1-18,231) seems to imply that giving the name of the former king Sennacherib (or that of Ashurbanipal, who was at that time either the ruling king or heir designate) to a commoner was considered taboo, a sacrilege punishable by the river ordeal; see Kataja, SAAB 1 (1987) pp. 65–68.      3  For a study of sources referring to Sennacherib from the reign of his son and successor Esarhaddon to the twentieth century, see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 21–28."

      "text": "Numerous inscriptions written in Sennacherib’s name have been recovered and most of these are housed in museum collections and private collections around the world; the majority of these are in the British Museum (London) and the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin). Many other inscribed objects of his that were discovered by early excavators were too large and heavy for transport or were in such bad condition that they were reburied and left in the field. Clay, stone, and metal objects bearing texts of this once-great king originate from a broad geographic area, although most come from the two principal cities of the Assyrian heartland: Aššur and Nineveh. The present corpus comprises both excavated objects and objects purchased from local dealers.      Because of the large number of texts and the length of some of those compositions (several of which are over 500 lines/2500 words long), the inscriptions of Sennacherib are edited in two volumes. Luckenbill, The Annals of Sennacherib (OIP 2), the last volume to edit a substantial portion of Sennacherib’s official texts, did not even include all of the then-known (1924) inscriptions and treated many complete inscriptions as duplicates, citing only orthographic and major variants from those sources. Since the publication of Luckenbill, Senn. over eighty-five years ago, numerous new inscriptions and (better preserved) duplicates have come to light. The present volume, although it contains only thirty-eight individual texts (approximately a sixth of the known corpus of inscriptions), surpasses Luckenbill’s publication in size.     The division of the Sennacherib corpus is somewhat arbitrary as we have tried to maintain a balance between Part 1 and Part 2 by including major, well-preserved inscriptions in both volumes. Because Part 2 will contain fewer long inscriptions than Part 1, all of the smaller texts will be edited in that volume. The present publication includes all historical inscriptions on clay cylinders, clay prisms, and stone tablets from Nineveh, while the second part will include historical inscriptions on bull and lion colossi from Nineveh, rock reliefs, stone horizontal prisms, and clay cylinders and prisms from other cities under Sennacherib’s authority (especially Aššur and Tarbiṣu). An inscription on several steles from Nineveh is also included in Part 1, while epigraphs on reliefs and inscriptions on clay tablets, bricks, threshold slabs, wall panels, stone blocks, beads, etc. are edited in Part 2. The arrangement of the inscriptions more or less follows that of Frahm, Einleitung in die Sanherib-Inschriften (AfO Beiheft 26). Note, however, that historical inscriptions on stone tablets and the text on steles (Frahm’s T 61–64) have been placed before inscriptions on bull and lion colossi, epigraphs, and texts written on door sockets, all of which were discovered in the ruins of the South-West Palace (Frahm’s T 25–60).     All of the inscriptions included in Part 1 originate from Nineveh. Most of the exemplars of those inscriptions come from Nineveh, but several exemplars were discovered at Aššur and Kalḫu (biblical Calah). These pieces (for example, text no. 4 exs. 9, 25, 43, 45, 48, 56, 60, 67, 69–70, 74 and 82–87) preserve texts duplicating inscriptions from Nineveh, including the building reports. Unless a fragment from Aššur and Kalḫu clearly preserves an inscription unique to those cities, those pieces are treated here as duplicates of the well-known Nineveh texts."

      "text": "Clay Prisms: General Introduction     Octagonal Clay Prisms     Hexagonal Clay Prisms     Stone Tablets with Historical and/or Building Narrative     Steles       Clay Cylinders    Inscriptions of Sennacherib written on clay cylinders and prisms from Nineveh were among the earliest cuneiform texts published in the nineteenth century, three of best known texts being the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3), whose popular name derives from the facsimile of the inscription that K. Bellino supplied to G.F. Grotefend for publication, the Rassam Cylinder (text no. 4), which is named after its excavator H. Rassam, and the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2), which is named after the man who purchased it (Col. J. Taylor). During the first years of Sennacherib’s reign, inscriptions were written on clay cylinders since those objects provided sufficient space for descriptions of both the king’s military campaigns and building enterprises. Text was inscribed in long lines that ran along the horizontal axis of the cylinder, from one end to the other. However, when the surface area of a cylinder proved inadequate for the space required for the ever-growing number of military reports and for more elaborate building accounts, Sennacherib had his scribes write his  res gestae  on upright, multi-columned clay prisms, a medium well suited for long texts. The transition from cylinders to prisms occurred in 698, the king’s 7th regnal year.     Inscriptions on clay cylinders fall into two categories: (1) texts with historical narrative followed by an account of construction at Nineveh (text nos. 1–9) and (2) inscriptions with no historical narrative, but only a report of work on a single structure at Nineveh (text no. 10, but probably also text nos. 11–13). The earliest known inscriptions were composed ca. 702, Sennacherib’s 3rd regnal year. The First Campaign Cylinder (text no. 1), although not dated, likely comes from the first half of 702 and describes in great detail a campaign against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan), an account of the construction of the king’s new royal residence, Egalzagdinutukua (the “Palace Without a Rival”; the South-West Palace at Nineveh), and the creation of a botanical garden and canals for irrigation. Later that same year (702), in the Elamite month Sibūti (= Araḫsamna [VIII]), two new texts appear: the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3) and a text combining elements of the First Campaign Cylinder and the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 2). Both inscriptions contain reports of Sennacherib’s first two campaigns and work on the “Palace Without a Rival”; the texts differ only in the building account. Two years later, in 700, a new inscription of the king’s deeds was commissioned (text no. 4 = Rassam Cylinder and “Cylinder B”) and produced in great number, which we know since several complete cylinders have been discovered and numerous fragments bearing this text have been identified. Building on previous texts, the Rassam Cylinder contains accounts of Sennacherib’s first three campaigns, including his dealings with Hezekiah of Judah, a short passage stating that Sennacherib formed a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers from prisoners, and a new description of the king’s palace at Nineveh. The amount of text inscribed on cylinders was proving difficult for the scribes as they attempted to write this ninety-four-line inscription with the exact same line divisions on each and every cylinder. The fully preserved copies have numerous erasures, dittographies, omissions, and cramped signs, attesting to the limitations the scribes faced as they wrote this edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  on clay cylinders. Despite these problems, cylinders were used as the principal clay medium at Nineveh for one more year. Two fragments of clay cylinders (text nos. 5 and 8) are dated to 699 (the king’s 6th regnal year) and another two fragments are thought to have been inscribed at that time (text nos. 6 and 7). Despite their poor state of preservation, we can surmise that these cylinders contained reports of Sennacherib’s first four campaigns, a passage mentioning a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers being formed from prisoners, and an account of building at Nineveh. The building reports of two of the fragments (text nos. 5 and 6) are completely missing; the account of the third fragment (text no. 7) records work on the citadel wall; and the building report of the fourth cylinder fragment (text no. 8) describes the creation of a botanical garden and canals for irrigation and the construction of Nineveh’s inner and outer walls, Badnigalbilukurašušu (“Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies”) and Badnigerimḫuluḫa (“Terrorizer of Enemies”). The building report of text no. 8 probably also recorded the rebuilding of the “Palace Without a Rival.”      A few clay cylinders with no historical narrative, but only a report of work on a single structure, are known from Nineveh. Although three of the four known texts in this category (text nos. 11–13) are not well preserved, the format of these inscriptions is similar to that of an inscription written on stone horizontal prisms discovered at Aššur (including VA 8254). These texts recorded (1) Sennacherib’s titles and epithets (which deviate from those found in texts with military narration), (2) an account of the rebuilding of a single building (most often a temple), (3) an appeal to the building’s foundation to speak favorably to the god Aššur (or the deity whose temple was being rebuilt), and (4) advice to future rulers (concluding formulae). The best preserved Nineveh example (text no. 10) records work on a temple of the god Ḫaya, the god of scribes. Since these texts are not dated and since they do not contain historical references, it is not known when these cylinders were written.      Clay Prisms: General Introduction    Beginning in 698, Sennacherib’s 7th regnal year, the writing of inscriptions with historical narrative on clay cylinders was abandoned in favor of a medium with more surface area, one conducive to the narration of lengthy reports of military successes and accounts of construction: hexagonal and octagonal prisms. Contrary to popular belief and despite the fact that the earliest extant hexagonal prism comes from 695 (the king’s 10th regnal year), six-sided prisms and eight-sided prisms were both used as foundation documents for the first time in 698. [4]  We can be certain about the date of transition since there is one known prism (text no. 14) dated to that year, the eponymy of Šulmu-šarri. Unfortunately, nothing has been published about the object or the text inscribed upon it except for the date the prism was written. Based on the latest editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  on cylinders (text nos. 5–8) and the known 697 edition on octagonal prisms (text no. 15), we can surmise that that inscription contained a short prologue, reports of the first four campaigns, a short passage stating that Sennacherib formed a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers from prisoners deported from conquered lands, a building report, and concluding formulae. [5]       Octagonal prisms are presently attested for 697–694 and 691 and these inscribed objects, as evident from the concluding formulae, were deposited primarily in Nineveh’s city walls. Hexagonal prisms are presently attested for 695, 693 (or 692), and 691–ca. 687. Some of these foundation records (text nos. 22–23 and 25), those inscribed in 691–688, were placed in the armory, as indicated by their building reports and concluding formulae. Presumably, six-sided prisms were commissioned and deposited in other buildings constructed anew or rebuilt at Nineveh, for example the “Palace Without a Rival.” We assume that texts were written on octagonal and hexagonal prisms every year from 698 to 689 and conjecture that these media were used until the end of Sennacherib’s reign (681).      Late in his reign, probably sometime after 689, Sennacherib had his scribes write his  res gestae  on decagonal clay prisms. These are very poorly attested, as this medium is represented by only two small fragments (text nos. 31–32). It is possible that ten-sided prisms replaced octagonal prisms sometime after 689 as foundation records deposited in Nineveh’s walls. Of course, this is just conjecture.      In addition, short texts of Sennacherib comprising only his titles and epithets and a short statement about the god Aššur supporting him as king are written on small ‘triangular’ prisms (text no. 27). It is not known if these curious prisms had some functional purpose (foundation deposit, site marker, etc.) and/or if they were scribal exercises written on practice prisms.       Octagonal Clay Prisms   The earliest attested eight-sided prisms (text no. 15 = so-called “Cylinder C”) were inscribed in the king’s 8th regnal year (697). That edition of Sennacherib’s accomplishments contains descriptions of his first four campaigns, a short passage stating that Sennacherib formed a military contingent from prisoners, a lengthy building report, and concluding formulae. As for the building report, it comprises: (1) an introduction to Sennacherib’s building program at Nineveh; (2) an account of the rebuilding of the palace Egalzagdinutukua and the planting of a botanical garden; (3) a report of the construction of the city walls Badnigalbilukurašušu and Badnigerimḫuluḫa, with their fourteen gates; (4) a general statement about other building activities at Nineveh; (5) a passage recording the building of a bridge and aqueducts; and (6) reports of the creation of gardens, orchards, a game preserve, and a marsh, and the digging of canals upstream and downstream of the city to irrigate those areas. Over the next two years (696–695), scribes of the king inscribed prisms with a text (text no. 16 = so-called “Cylinder D”) containing reports of his first five campaigns, the same passage summarizing the formation of a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers, and a building report that was nearly identical to that of the 697 edition (text no. 15). In Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year (694), inscriptions intended to be deposited in the city walls of Nineveh were updated once again. The historical narrative (text no. 17 = King and Heidel Prisms) now contained reports of the first five campaigns and military expeditions that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695), a passage summarizing the king’s spoils of war, and an updated account of the construction of Sennacherib’s palace, the creation of a botanical garden and canals for irrigation, and the building of Nineveh’s walls, which were now reported to have fifteen gates. No octagonal prisms for Sennacherib’s 12th (693) and 13th (692) regnal years are presently known, but presumably new texts were composed during those two years. The 693 edition(s) would have contained reports of the first six campaigns, while the 692 edition(s) would have had accounts of his first seven campaigns. [6]  The latest certain eight-sided prism dates to his 14th regnal year (691). Although that inscription (text no. 18) is very fragmentarily preserved, this 691 edition would have been one of the longest inscriptions written under the auspices of Sennacherib, as it would have been more than 800 lines long. Despite the many lacunae in the text, we are certain that that inscription contained reports of eight campaigns and a very detailed account of Sennacherib’s numerous building activities at Nineveh.        Hexagonal Clay Prisms   Only three fragments of hexagonal clay prisms (text nos. 19–21) are known from the period prior to 691 (Sennacherib’s 14th regnal year) and these come from prisms that were inscribed in 695–693 (or 695–692). Because only a very small portion of those inscriptions is preserved, little can be said with certainty about those editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae . It is certain, however, that the military narration of these inscriptions duplicates that of Smith Bull 4, an inscription written on a bull colossus stationed in Court H, Door  a  of Sennacherib’s palace (the South-West Palace), [7]  and that the military narration of the 695 edition (text no. 19) ended with an account of the fifth campaign and a short passage stating that Sennacherib formed a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers from prisoners deported from conquered lands. As for the building reports, they may have described work on the “Palace Without a Rival” (as suggested by the similarity of the military narration to texts inscribed on bull colossi stationed in that building), the armory, or some other structure at Nineveh.    Most of Sennacherib’s inscriptions on hexagonal prisms come from the period between 691 and 689; certainly the best known texts of his — the Chicago Prism (text no. 22 ex. 1), the Jerusalem Prism (text no. 23 ex. 1), and the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2) — date to this time. During Sennacherib’s 14th–16th regnal years, two nearly identical texts (text nos. 22–23) were inscribed on prisms deposited in the armory, which is located south of the citadel, along the western wall, in the mound of Nebi Yunus. Both inscriptions include a short prologue, reports of Sennacherib’s first eight campaigns, an account of the rebuilding of the armory (the “Rear Palace”), and concluding formulae. Because the month during which the Jerusalem Prism (text no. 23 ex. 1) was inscribed is not preserved, it is not known with absolute certainty which edition of this king’s  res gestae  is earlier: text no. 22 or text no. 23. The fact that the building report of text no. 23 is shorter than that of text no. 22 and that it describes the construction of only one wing of the armory, rather than two wings of that building, may suggest that the text inscribed on the Jerusalem Prism is earlier in date than the one written on the Chicago Prism and the Taylor Prism.     After the capture and subsequent destruction of Babylon in late 689, Sennacherib continued to have texts inscribed on hexagonal prisms (text nos. 24–26). Like the period prior to 691, very few fragments of six-sided prisms have been identified for the post-689 period and those that are extant are fragmentarily preserved. When complete, text nos. 24 and 25, both of which were written ca. 688, would have included a prologue, reports of Sennacherib’s first eight campaigns, an account of the conquest of Babylon in 689, the building report, and concluding formulae; one or both texts may have also included a passage describing the king’s Arabian campaign. As for the building reports, it is not certain what the building account of text no. 24 commemorated, but that of text no. 25 recorded the rebuilding of the armory (the “Rear Palace”). [8]  A fragment of a prism that was inscribed ca. 687 (text no. 26) contains an inscription that summarizes Sennacherib’s many accomplishments on the battlefield and describes one of his building projects at Nineveh. The text, as far as it is preserved, duplicates (with variations) several summary inscriptions that were written on stone tablets, text nos. 34–35. It is not known where prisms inscribed with that text were deposited since their building reports are completely missing. Based on similarities with inscriptions on stone tablets, the building report of text no. 26 may have recorded work on the armory.       Stone Tablets with Historical and/or Building Narrative    In addition to smaller clay foundation deposits and inscribed bricks built into the superstructure of buildings and walls, Sennacherib’s scribes and craftsmen wrote out and engraved texts on a variety of large stone objects, including foundation tablets. Only a handful of stone tablets from Nineveh are known (text nos. 34–37). Each tablet was inscribed in a single column of text, on both the front and back faces. In the 1929–30 campaign of R.C. Thompson at Nineveh, a small, broken stone tablet (text no. 36) was discovered in the area between the Nabû and Ištar temples. This piece likely dates to ca. 702, the same time as the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3). When complete, the text included an invocation of gods (beginning with Aššur and ending with Ištar and the Sebetti), reports of the first two campaigns, an account of the rebuilding of numerous dilapidated temples located in Nineveh’s citadel (which are said to have been last built by Ashurnasirpal II), and concluding formulae. This inscription is one of the few contemporary pieces of evidence for Sennacherib working on existing temples at Nineveh.       The other known texts written on tablets from Nineveh with historical and/or building narratives were all composed ca. 691–689. The largest and best preserved of these (text no. 34 = Constantinople Inscription, Memorial Tablet, and Nebi Yunus Inscription) was reported to have been discovered at Nebi Yunus in 1852 (or 1854?). That inscription contains summaries of Sennacherib’s first eight campaigns and military expeditions that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695) and a detailed description of the rebuilding of the armory. Two fragmentary exemplars of another text with historical narrative (text no. 35 = Ungnad and Winckler Stone Tablet Fragments Inscription) preserve a text similar, but not identical, to text no. 34; one significant difference is that this inscription includes a report of a campaign against the Arabs. As the building report is not sufficiently preserved and since nothing is known of the original find spots of the tablet fragments, nothing can be said with certainty about where Sennacherib had tablets bearing this text placed. Based on the approximate date of composition (ca. 690–689) and the mention of the king reviewing valuable enemy booty (reading not entirely certain), these objects may have also been placed in Nineveh’s armory.       A small limestone tablet discovered at the Nergal Gate of Nineveh in 1992–93 is inscribed with a text (text no. 37) concerning work on an  akītu -house (a temple for the celebration of New Year rituals) at Nineveh that Sennacherib had built outside the newly constructed wall of the city. Although only the beginning and end of the inscription are preserved, it is certain that this text did not include reports of military narration. The tablet is dated to the eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur (690) and the text gives some insight into political-religious reforms that were initiated in Assyria: at Nineveh the former  akītu -house, which had last been built by Sennacherib’s father and which was now situated inside the expanded circumference of Nineveh’s wall, was abandoned and replaced by a new building located outside the city, north of the Nergal Gate. [9]        Steles   As part of his urban renewal and expansion of Nineveh, Sennacherib created a royal road. To ensure that no one would build a house that would encroach upon that royal road, the king had round-topped steles (each with an image of the king standing before symbols of his tutelary deities) erected on both sides of the road. Three of the steles (text no. 38 = Inscription from the Royal Road) lining this road, which may have run from the Aššur Gate in the south wall to the Sîn Gate (formerly the Gate of the Garden) at the western end of the north wall, are extant today, while several others are reported to have been broken up and burnt into lime in the nineteenth century. The steles, although not dated, may have been inscribed ca. 693–691.        Notes       4  Cf., for example, Reade, JCS 27 (1975) pp. 189–196; and Frahm, Sanherib p. 65.      5  See the commentary of text no. 14 for further information.      6  The numbering of this king’s campaigns follows the designations given in Sennacherib’s inscriptions. Therefore, the sixth, seventh, and eighth campaigns are respectively his campaigns against the Chaldeans living in Elam, against Elam, and the battle of Ḫalulê. The military expeditions of 696 and 695, which were led by his officials, are referred to by the eponymy in which they were conducted. Although the campaign of 696 is technically Sennacherib’s “sixth” campaign, that event is never referred to as such by Sennacherib’s scribes since the king did not personally lead his troops on campaign.       7  For a copy of Smith Bull 4, see 3 R pls. 12–13.      8  E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 107) suggests that the building report of text no. 24 may have described the rebuilding of the Sebetti temple in Nineveh. For further information, see the commentary of text no. 24 and the on-page note to vi 17'–18' of that inscription.        9  At Aššur, Sennacherib also rebuilt an  akītu -house outside the city. For details on the two  akītu -houses at Nineveh, see Frahm, NABU 2000 pp. 75–79 no. 66."

      "text": "Sennacherib has been a popular subject of study from the very beginning of Assyriology. There are numerous books, dissertations and articles devoted to him, his inscriptions, and his reign. [10]  Clay, stone, and metal objects bearing texts of this once-great king were among the earliest cuneiform texts brought back to Europe and deciphered in the mid-nineteenth century. The birth of the modern study of Sennacherib and his inscriptions began well before the decipherment of Akkadian cuneiform, when C.J. Rich visited Mosul in 1820 and acquired what he described as “a small earthen vase covered with cuneiform writing.” Shortly thereafter, K. Bellino, his secretary, made a facsimile of the text, which he sent to G.F. Grotefend, a man who had by that time already made several breakthroughs in the decipherment of the Old Persian language, also written in cuneiform. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, objects inscribed with cuneiform writing were purchased from local dealers and brought back to Europe, where they made their way into museums and private collections. The discovery of Assyrian palaces at Khorsabad (ancient Dūr-Šarrukīn), Nimrud (ancient Kalḫu, biblical Calah), and Nineveh in the 1840s, the display of those objects in the British Museum (London) and the Louvre (Paris), and the publication of popular accounts of their discovery (with their fanciful reconstructions) generated a great deal of interest in the decipherment of “Assyrian” cuneiform and the history of kings named in the Bible. [11]       From 1850 to the present, numerous works, large and small, have been devoted to Sennacherib. Because this is not the place to present a complete and detailed historical survey of the publication of the Sennacherib corpus, or to provide a complete bibliographical study of this king, we will focus on previous editions (and translations) and major studies of the corpus that have advanced our knowledge of this king’s royal inscriptions. Extensive bibliographies are provided for each text.      Treatments of Sennacherib and his reign are to be found in every general history of Assyria or Mesopotamia. Particularly useful are the biographical sketches by A.K. Grayson in CAH 2  3/2 and by E. Frahm in Sanherib, as well as the entries on Sennacherib by E. Frahm in PNA 3/1 pp. 1113–1127 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība and RLA 12/1–2 (2009) pp. 12–22. Translations of selected inscriptions of his, usually those with descriptions of his campaign to the Levant, often appear in collected works of Mesopotamian texts in translation, for example, Borger in Galling, Textbuch 2 ; Oppenheim in ANET 3 ; Borger in TUAT 1/4; Cogan in COS 2; Melville in Chavalas, ANE; and Cogan, Raging Torrent.      Before discussing previous editions and major studies of this text corpus, we would like to cite here other works in which Sennacherib texts have been published. For copies, typeset Neo-Assyrian or hand-drawn facsimiles, see: Layard, Monuments; Layard, ICC; 1 R; 3 R; Ungnad, VAS 1; Messerschmidt, KAH 1; Schroeder, KAH 2; King, PSBA 35 (1913) pp. 66–94; Thompson, Arch. 79 (1929); Thompson, AAA 18 (1931); Thompson, AAA 19 (1932); and Marzahn and Rost, VAS 23. For editions/transliterations of a single text, or a very small group of texts, often accompanied by a copy and/or photograph(s), see in particular: King, CT 26; S. Smith, Senn.; Jacobsen and Lloyd, OIP 24; Thompson, Iraq 7 (1940); Heidel, Sumer 9 (1953); Grayson, AfO 20 (1963); Walker, CBI; George, Iraq 48 (1986); Galter, ARRIM 5 (1987); Ling-Israel, Studies Artzi; Ahmad and Grayson, Iraq 61 (1999); Frahm, ISIMU 6 (2003); Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels; and Frahm, KAL 3. Information on objects inscribed with inscriptions of Sennacherib is provided in numerous museum and excavation catalogues. The most useful of these are: Bezold, Cat. 1–4; King, Cat.; Lambert and Millard, Cat.; Pedersén, Katalog; and Lambert, Cat.     In 1878, G. Smith’s History of Sennacherib, Translated from the Cuneiform Inscriptions was the first book dedicated entirely to Sennacherib’s inscriptions. Work on the volume began in November 1871 and it was expected to be 300 to 400 pages long. Smith had prepared as far as page 152 when the publisher revealed to Smith that the cost of publication would far exceed the original estimate. The project was suspended, in part due to an expedition that Smith took to “Assyria.” Smith hoped to complete his history of Sennacherib when he returned, with the help of new inscriptions he expected to discover in the ruins of Nineveh. Smith never saw the completed publication of the fruits of his labors, as he died in August 1876. His manuscript was then handed over to J.W. Bosanquet to finish, but he too died suddenly. Before his death, Bosanquet was able to write a short essay on the date of the siege of Lachish (Appendix 1). In 1878, A.H. Sayce completed Smith’s History of Sennacherib, namely by preparing the final thirteen pages of the text editions. The format of the volume was modeled upon Smith’s History of Assurbanipal Translated from the Cuneiform Sources. The texts were edited passage by passage (prologue, first campaign, etc.), with the master text appearing in typeset Neo-Assyrian cuneiform, beneath which appeared the corresponding transliteration and English translation. Occasionally minor variants were cited and some major variants were edited after the master text. In total, twenty-three texts were utilized, including the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3), the Rassam Cylinder (text no. 4; = his Cylinder B), Smith Bull 4, the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2), the Nebi Yunus Inscription (text no. 34; = his Memorial Tablet), and the Bavian Inscription.      In 1890, in a volume of Neo-Assyrian historical texts edited by E. Schrader (KB 2), C. Bezold published editions of a handful of Sennacherib inscriptions. His contribution included full editions of the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2) and the two epigraphs on the Lachish Room reliefs, and very short excerpts from the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3), the Rassam Cylinder (text no. 4), and the Nebi Yunus Inscription (text no. 34). Bezold, unlike G. Smith, gave extensive notes on textual variants. His critical apparatus included variants from seven (hexagonal and octagonal) clay prisms, fourteen clay cylinders, one bull inscription, and two clay tablets.      Three years later, in 1893, B. Meissner and P. Rost published their Die Bauinschriften Sanheribs; this was the second volume devoted entirely to the inscriptions of Sennacherib. Meissner and Rost’s edition focused only on the building reports of the then well-known inscriptions, especially those describing the construction of the “Palace Without a Rival” (the South-West Palace) and the armory (the “Rear Palace”). Five cylinders, one clay tablet, fragments of five inscribed bull colossi, and one clay prism were used in their composite edition of Sennacherib’s description of the construction of his royal residence. The building reports of the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2) and the Nebi Yunus Inscription (text no. 34) were combined as a single account of the rebuilding of the armory. Just as Bezold had done in KB 2, Meissner and Rost provided extensive notes on minor and major variants. Unlike Smith and Bezold, they provided detailed philological commentary. In addition to the two main composite building reports, editions of eighteen other short texts, all concerned with Sennacherib’s building activities (including those at Kalḫu and Tarbiṣu), were included in the volume. Hand-drawn facsimiles of fifteen texts accompanied the editions.      In 1924, D.D. Luckenbill published The Annals of Sennacherib in the series Oriental Institute Publications (vol. 2) because he felt there was “a crying need for an up-to-date publication of the Assyrian sources,” and because it seemed “the opportune moment to make available in translation a complete body of Sennacherib’s historical and building texts.” The acquisition by the Oriental Institute of a six-sided clay prism in “almost as perfect condition as when it left the hands of the ancient scribe” and the fact that many of Sennacherib’s inscriptions had already been edited for incorporation into the files of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary were further incentive for him to pursue this publication. Luckenbill was influenced by A.T.E. Olmstead’s Assyrian Historiography and took to heart the latter’s complaint about the growing tendency to use only “the final Assyrian edition,” and thus Luckenbill edited the earlier or alternate versions of reports known in Sennacherib’s “final edition of the annals” separately. Duplicate passages, however, were still not edited as independent texts; minor, orthographic variants appearing in those texts were cited in on-page notes. In total, sixty-four objects inscribed with texts of Sennacherib, with the Chicago Prism (text no. 22 ex. 1) as the centerpiece of the book, were utilized. Of these, seven clay cylinders, four clay prisms, two clay tablets, three bull colossi, two stone tablets, and two rock reliefs were used for his edition of the annals and their building reports. Photographs and a hand-drawn facsimile of the Chicago Prism accompanied the editions. Editions of forty-four building inscriptions, texts that did not include annalistic narration, and epigraphs were also included. Most of those were short texts inscribed on limestone blocks, door sockets, and bricks, many of which were discovered at Aššur and published in copy in Messerschmidt, KAH 1 and Schroeder, KAH 2. Although Luckenbill states that he made available “a complete body of Sennacherib’s historical and building texts,” he did not publish all of the then-known inscriptions; he appears to have made use of texts published in only twelve books and journals. Nevertheless, Luckenbill’s The Annals of Sennacherib was at that time the most comprehensive volume of Sennacherib inscriptions. Three years later, in 1927, Luckenbill included the translations of The Annals of Sennacherib in his Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia (vol. 2), a two-volume set that published English translations of the entire corpus of Assyrian royal inscriptions.    In 1963, R. Borger published his three-volume Babylonisch-assyrische Lesestücke, which included a hand-drawn facsimile and a transliteration of the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2). Borger took the opportunity in the introduction to that text to provide up-to-date information about the historical inscriptions of Sennacherib. Relevant information was provided for inscriptions on clay cylinders, clay prisms, bull colossi, clay tablets, stone tablets, and rock reliefs. Numerous unpublished cylinders, prisms, and tablets catalogued by C. Bezold (Cat. 1–4) and L.W. King (Cat.) were listed under the edition to which they belonged. Borger, unlike Luckenbill forty years earlier, made a concerted effort to gather in one place all of the known published and still-unpublished sources for Sennacherib’s historical texts. That contribution formed the solid base upon which most future studies and editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  were to be built.      In 1967, G.L. Russell completed and submitted a dissertation entitled Sennacherib’s Annals: A Foundational Text Study (Dropsie College). His work was to present a detailed study for a new edition of the Sennacherib corpus. Building upon Luckenbill’s 1924 publication, Russell’s unpublished dissertation arranged the texts into three groups (annalistic material, building inscriptions, and varia [unclassified texts]), discussed the style of the inscriptions, and presented new editions of six historical texts (with some commentary). The inscriptions edited were: the First Campaign Cylinder (text no. 1), the Bellino Cylinder (text no. 3), the Rassam Cylinder (text no. 4), the King Prism and Heidel Prism (text no. 17 exs. 1–2), Smith Bull 3, and the Judi Dagh Inscription. A list of 118 inscriptions was included in an appendix. That list was compiled for a projected new edition of the entire Sennacherib corpus, a work that was never completed.     J.E. Reade felt that the textual evidence for following the evolution of Sennacherib’s building and irrigation projects in and around Nineveh was not as accessible as one could hope for. In July and August 1974, he carefully examined in the British Museum the published and unpublished Sennacherib prisms, as well as some unidentified prism fragments. His work was facilitated by W.G. Lambert, E. Leichty, and A.R. Millard. The fruits of his labors were published as “Sources for Sennacherib: The Prisms,” which appeared in JCS 27 (1975) pp. 189–196. That article presented information on all of the known and conjectured  res gestae  of Sennacherib that were inscribed on octagonal and hexagonal clay prisms from Nineveh. Reade’s study benefited greatly from Borger, BAL and Lambert and Millard, Cat. From published and unpublished material, Reade was able to identify twelve different prism editions, several more than previously thought.     Borger published a second edition of his Babylonisch-assyrische Lesestücke in 1979. He did not, however, substantially update his study of Sennacherib’s historical texts.      At a colloquium held in Jerusalem on May 9th 1979, L.D. Levine delivered a lecture on the inscriptions of Sennacherib. A few years later, in 1983, he published his “Preliminary Remarks on the Historical Inscriptions of Sennacherib” in History, Historiography, and Interpretation: Studies in Biblical and Cuneiform Literatures, edited by H. Tadmor and M. Weinfeld. In that work, he reviewed the history of research on Sennacherib’s inscriptions, provided a general discussion of the sources and corpus, and discussed various methods of editing this large corpus.      The most comprehensive study of Sennacherib, his reign, and his inscriptions was published by E. Frahm in 1997. Einleitung in die Sanherib-Inschriften (AfO Beiheft 26) was the product of his 1996 doctoral dissertation (Universität Göttingen), which was written under the supervision of Borger. Frahm’s careful study not only included up-to-date information on the nearly two hundred royal inscriptions composed under the auspices of this Assyrian king, but also included detailed studies on Sennacherib’s reign and its legacy; his family; his character; previous research (1820–1996); the function of the texts; the language, structure, and style of the inscriptions; aspects of the military reports; his building activities; the role of the king in the composition of royal inscriptions; and the inscriptions as sources for Sennacherib’s religious views. For each text, Frahm provided information on the principal sources (main exemplars and duplicates), previous publications, provenance, contents, and date of composition. For many texts, he gave historical and philological commentary, including information on old misreadings of signs and words, as well as other errors (or misinterpretations) in previous publications. Difficult-to-read passages were often clarified by collation, for which he provided copies. Although some editions are provided in the volume, few texts were edited in full (for example, text no. 4 is fully edited, with all minor variants listed). The book also included a catalogue of sources and selected hand-drawn copies. Frahm did not intend his Einleitung in die Sanherib-Inschriften to be a new edition of the complete corpus of Sennacherib inscriptions; this was in part because A.K. Grayson was already preparing such a publication. It is, as indicated by its title, an introduction to Sennacherib’s inscriptions, and a very good and comprehensive primer on the subject.         Notes      10  For a good historical survey of previous work on the Sennacherib corpus (1820–1997), see Levine, History, Historiography and Interpretation pp. 59–64; and Frahm, Sanherib pp. 29–32.      11  For a recent study on the early explorations of Assyria, see in particular Larsen, Conquest of Assyria."

      "text": "Although many of the events of Sennacherib’s reign are well documented in his  res gestae , the internal chronology of his twenty-four-year reign is not as certain as one would like. There is difficulty not only about the precise years of some of the royal expeditions, but also about how many there were. The problem of dating arises out of the fact that Sennacherib’s campaigns are generally not dated by eponym or regnal year, but are merely numbered sequentially as first, second, third, etc. [12]  The official numbering, which goes up to eight in the extant corpus, included only expeditions personally led by the king. Campaigns led by Sennacherib’s officials were usually excluded from royally sponsored compositions. Two of those, however, were recorded in some official inscriptions, but they were never given an official campaign number. This intentional omission of events and the fact that few texts written after his 16th regnal year (689) survive today make it impossible to know the exact number of campaigns. Chronographic texts, unfortunately, shed little light on this problem, as the Eponym Chronicle is not preserved except for the beginning of his reign, and as the Babylonian Chronicle is concerned only with events in Babylonia (and Elam). Furthermore, the latter text records events by the regnal years of Babylonian kings, without reference to Sennacherib’s regnal years. [13]  Thus, despite the numerous sources for Sennacherib’s reign, there are still many gaps in our knowledge.     In total, twelve campaigns are recorded in the extant corpus of Sennacherib’s inscriptions. These took place between his accession year (705) and his 16th regnal year (689). Events from his 17th regnal year (688) to his death in 681 (his 24th regnal year), however, are completely unknown. Eight campaigns were given an official number, while the other four were not. Two campaigns led by the king’s officials are also known. Those events were never given an official campaign number; their date, however, is known as one inscription records the regnal years during which they took place (696 and 695; Sennacherib’s 9th and 10th regnal years). It is unclear how the second conquest of Babylon (689), which is referred to as his second campaign in the Bavian Inscription, [14]  and the campaign to Arabia were designated in Sennacherib’s annalistic texts since reports of the former event are not preserved in extant foundation inscriptions (those written on clay prisms) and since the latter event is known only from a badly damaged summary inscription, a text where official campaign numbers were not included. More specifically, we do not know if Sennacherib referred to the second conquest of Babylon as his ninth campaign and the Arabian expedition as his tenth campaign.

It has been suggested that these discrepancies arose because the Assyrians were not accustomed to dating texts by regnal year (that is, in a Babylonian fashion) or because Assyrian scribes did not always achieve precision when calculating dates according to varying calendrical systems. On “double datings,” see Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 70–71. For example, the Baltimore Inscription line 126 (Grayson, AfO 20 [1963] p. 96) states that the eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur was Sennacherib’s 14th regnal year, thus making 703 his 1st regnal year.       13  For translations of the chronographic texts, see pp. 23–27.      14  Luckenbill, Senn. p. 83 line 43:  i-na  2- i ger-ri-ia  “on my second campaign.” Note that the Bavian Inscription, which will be edited in Part 2, records only two campaigns: (1) the battle of Ḫalulê (the eighth campaign) and (2) the second conquest of Babylon.      15  Y= Yes, campaign included. We assume that text no. 14 included the first four campaigns, but line numbers cannot be assigned since that text is unpublished and not available for study.      16  Text nos. 28–33 are excluded from Table 2c since those inscriptions are not well preserved."

      "text": "Babylonian and Elamite Campaigns     The biggest problems Sennacherib faced were Babylonia and Elam. Throughout his reign, he wrestled with the problem of ruling the land of Sumer and Akkad, and attempted various solutions, none of which worked. [17]  Between 705 and 689, Sennacherib undertook military action against Babylonia and its ally, the land Elam, no fewer than six times. [18]   Ultimately, Sennacherib resorted to drastic action and captured and destroyed Babylon; Marduk, the city’s tutelary deity, his entourage, and possessions were carried off into captivity, where they remained in exile until 668.     The initial transition of power in Babylonia (705) appears to have been fairly smooth. Sennacherib took direct control of Sumer and Akkad, [19]  but the situation quickly deteriorated. Marduk-zākir-šumi II led a rebellion and seized power at the beginning of Sennacherib’s 1st regnal year (704). His tenure as king was very brief; Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) deposed him after only one month. For nine months, Sennacherib left his Chaldean rival unchallenged, probably because his attention was drawn elsewhere. [20]  During those nine months, Marduk-apla-iddina strengthened his position as king by gathering support from the citizens of prominent Babylonian cities, Chaldean and Aramean tribal groups, the Arabs, and the king of Elam (Šutur-Naḫundu = Šutruk-Naḫḫunte II). On the twentieth day of the month Šabāṭu (XI), Sennacherib set out from Aššur with his army. In advance of the king, troops under the authority of the chief official and several provincial governors were dispatched to Kish; Sennacherib and his host marched on Cutha. While Cutha was under attack, the contingent sent to Kish faced off with Marduk-apla-iddina and his supporters. The initial confrontation at Kish met with failure. But when the main body of the Assyrian army arrived after capturing Cutha, Marduk-apla-iddina became frightened, fled the battlefield, and eluded capture. The Assyrians searched for him in the marshes, but their efforts were in vain. As his army fought and defeated other enemy contingents, Sennacherib marched to Babylon, where he plundered Marduk-apla-iddina’s palace. [21]  Over the course of his 2nd regnal year (703), the Assyrians brought order back to Babylonia. Numerous Chaldean-controlled cities and towns were conquered and mass deportations took place. Sennacherib attempted to rule Sumer and Akkad through a puppet ruler in Babylon. Late in the year, Bēl-ibni, who is described as “a son of a  rab banî  (and) a scion of Šuanna (Babylon) who had grown up like a young puppy in my palace,” was installed as king.      As the Assyrians withdrew, probably at the beginning of Sennacherib’s 3rd regnal year (702), numerous Aramean tribes were plundered, a substantial voluntary payment was received from Nabû-bēl-šumāti (the official in charge of the city Ḫararatu), and the city Ḫirimmu was captured.        For the next two years, Sennacherib left Babylonia in the hands of Bēl-ibni. With Assyrian attention drawn elsewhere, Marduk-apla-iddina took the opportunity to make his presence felt. By early 700 (Sennacherib’s 5th regnal year and Bēl-ibni’s 3rd regnal year), Bēl-ibni’s jurisdiction appears to have been restricted to northern Babylonia; the Chaldeans were in control of the south. To remedy the situation, Sennacherib marched into Babylonia; he officially regarded this expedition as his fourth campaign. [22]  First, he hunted down a man called Šūzubu (who must be identical to Mušēzib-Marduk), a new, influential Chaldean leader. That Chaldean was defeated at the city Bittūtu; he fled before the Assyrians could capture him. Sennacherib then advanced on Bīt-Yakīn. Marduk-apla-iddina, as he had done many times before, ran away. He fled by ship across the Persian Gulf to Elam; his abandoned family and supporters were captured and deported to Assyria. On his return march, the Assyrian king removed Bēl-ibni and his officials, whether for incompetence or disloyalty is not known, and installed in Bēl-ibni’s place Aššur-nādin-šumi, Sennacherib’s eldest son. This arrangement ensured Assyrian control over Babylonia for the next six years.     In his 11th regnal year (694), Sennacherib decided to attack the Bīt-Yakīn exiles living in Elam and the Elamites who had granted them asylum; the expedition is officially designated as his sixth campaign. [23]  To catch the enemy off guard, Sennacherib decided to enter Elam via the Persian Gulf. Syrian ships were built at Nineveh and then sailed down the Tigris River to Opis, at which point the boats were dragged overland to the Araḫtu; the ships were manned by well-trained sailors from Tyre, Sidon, and Cyprus (or Ionia). Assyrian troops, horses, and their supplies and equipment were loaded onto the ships and sailed down the Tigris. Sennacherib and his elite troops, however, remained on shore and marched along the bank. Once they reached the head of the Persian Gulf, the advance was delayed for five days; this may have been due to the fact that the Phoenician sailors were not accustomed to the strong gulf tide. After this minor setback, which Sennacherib claims to have resolved by making an offering to the god Ea, the Assyrians sailed over to the Elamite coast. Upon landing, the Elamite cities that had granted asylum to exiles from Bīt-Yakīn were captured and plundered. The Bīt-Yakīn exiles and the Elamites who took them in were loaded onto boats and transported back across the Persian Gulf. From all appearances, this campaign should have been a resounding success for Sennacherib. However, this was not the case, as the Assyrian king had been outwitted.      While the Assyrian army was busy in Elam, the Elamite king Ḫallušu (Ḫallutaš-Inšušinak) had invaded northern Babylonia through the Diyala valley and occupied Sippar. The Babylonians struck a deal with Ḫallušu: they handed over Aššur-nādin-šumi and the king of Elam appointed Nergal-ušēzib (of the Gaḫul [Gaḫal] family) as king of Babylon in his place; Aššur-nādin-šumi was carried off to Elam. Sennacherib was caught completely off guard when he returned to Babylonia. The Assyrians had to fight their way north. The fighting was fierce and the conflict continued into the next year (693; Sennacherib’s 12th regnal year and Nergal-ušēzib’s 1st regnal year). Nergal-ušēzib managed to capture Nippur, while the Assyrians were able to take Uruk. In the month Tašrītu (VII), Sennacherib and Nergal-ušēzib fought a pitched battle near Nippur. The Assyrians won the day. Nergal-ušēzib was taken prisoner and carried back to Nineveh, where he was publicly humiliated.      Sennacherib, enraged by the fact that the Elamite king had carried off his son, immediately sought to exact revenge on Elam. The situation in Elam was ripe to launch a full military assault: Ḫallušu (Ḫallutaš-Inšušinak) had just been deposed and executed in an insurrection. Almost immediately after returning home in late 693, Sennacherib mustered his army and marched directly into Elamite territory; this was officially his seventh campaign. [24]  Several border cities, including Rāši, were captured, garrisoned with Assyrian troops, and placed under the authority of the garrison commander of the city Dēr. Thirty-four cities are reported to have been captured, plundered, and destroyed. Kudur-Naḫundu (Kudur-Naḫḫunte), the newly enthroned Elamite king, heard the bad news and fled. Sennacherib ordered the march to the royal city Madaktu, but deep winter set in during the month Ṭebētu (X) and the Assyrians felt it best to return home. Thus, the final conflict with Elam was postponed. Meanwhile, Mušēzib-Marduk (Šūzubu), the same influential Chaldean whom Sennacherib had defeated several years earlier (700), became king in Babylon. [25]     What transpired in Sennacherib’s 13th regnal year (692, Mušēzib-Marduk’s 1st regnal year) is not entirely clear. Chronographic sources are silent on the matter and record only that Kudur-Naḫundu was deposed in the month Abu (V) and succeeded by Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu). Mušēzib-Marduk, as Sennacherib reports, was strengthening his ties at home and abroad. A substantial bribe was sent to the Elamite king, enticing Elam once again to bring its armies onto Babylonian soil. Sennacherib caught wind of the situation brewing in the south, mustered his army, and marched against the king of Babylon and his allies. This campaign, which is the eighth campaign by official reckoning, is generally thought to have taken place in Sennacherib’s 14th regnal year (691, Mušēzib-Marduk’s 2nd regnal year). [26]  Sennacherib confronted Mušēzib-Marduk, Umman-menanu, and their allies in the plain near the city Ḫalulê. The true outcome of the battle is obscured by conflicting accounts of the event. [27]  The Babylonian Chronicle records an Assyrian retreat, while Sennacherib’s  res gestae  describe in a highly poetic style a total rout of the enemy. The fact that Mušēzib-Marduk remained in power may suggest that the Assyrians suffered a setback at Ḫalulê. In any event, any setback was short lived, as Assyrian troops started laying siege to Babylon by the middle of 690 (Sennacherib’s 15th regnal year and Mušēzib-Marduk’s 3rd regnal year). [28]       Despite the desperate state of affairs, Babylon and Mušēzib-Marduk refused to submit for another fifteen months. On the 1st day of the month Kislīmu (IX) 689 (Sennacherib’s 16th regnal year and Mušēzib-Marduk’s 4th regnal year), Babylon fell. [29]  Sennacherib records that he utterly destroyed Babylon and its temples by diverting water from canals to completely wash away the mud-brick structures, making it impossible for future generations to recognize the ground plans of the city and its buildings. The actual destruction was probably not as bad as Sennacherib describes. [30]      Sennacherib ruled Babylonia directly for the next eight years (688–681), but the extent of his affairs there is not known. He did not assume the titles “king of Babylon,” “viceroy of Babylon,” or “king of Sumer and Akkad,” and he does not appear to have sponsored building activities there. His involvement may have been very limited as one Babylonian chronicle and the Ptolemaic Canon considered Sennacherib’s second tenure as ruler of Babylon to be “kingless.”           Notes       17  For details on Babylonia during the reign of Sennacherib, see Brinkman, Prelude pp. 54–70; and Frame, Babylonia pp. 52–63.        18  For studies of his Babylonian and Elamite campaigns, see for example Böhl, Orientalia Neerlandica (1948) pp. 116–137; Brinkman, Studies Oppenheim pp. 22–27; Grayson, Studies Landsberger p. 342; Levine, JCS 34 (1982) pp. 29–55; Brinkman, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 32–40; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 105–109; W.

In addition to Sennacherib’s royal inscriptions, the following sources provide information on Sennacherib’s first stint as king of Babylon and the first campaign: the Eponym Chronicle (see below), the Babylonian Chronicle (see below), Babylonian Kinglist A iv 13–15 (see below), the Ptolemaic Canon (see below), the Synchronistic King List iv 1–3 (see below), and the  Babyloniaca  of Berossus (Burstein, SANE 1/5 [1978] p. 23; G. De Breucker’s annotated online edition of the text is also available [by subscription] on the Brill Online website: http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=bnj_a680  [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=bnj_a680]  [2012]). Because of the ambiguity of the Assyrian sources and because data in Babylonian Kinglist A and the Babylonian Chronicle seem to imply that Sennacherib remained in charge of Babylonia in 705 and 704, scholars have been divided on the date of the first campaign. J.A. Brinkman (Studies Oppenheim pp. 22–26; Prelude pp. 56–59; and CAH 2  3/2 pp. 32–34) suggests that the campaign began in late 703, while L.D. Levine (JCS 34 [1982] pp. 28–40) proposes that it started one year earlier, in late 704. Levine’s chronology is followed here, as it is by E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 7 and 9–10; and ISIMU 6 [2003] pp. 129–130).       20  The Eponym Chronicle (see below) records that Sennacherib sent his officials against the Kulummians in Tabal to avenge his father’s death. E. Frahm (ISIMU 6 [2003] p. 130) forwards the idea that “Sennacherib may have found it too risky to engage his troops in two dangerous spots in the north and in the south at the same time” and therefore did not march into Babylonia immediately after Marduk-apla-iddina II seized the throne.       21  It is uncertain if Sennacherib participated in the  akītu -festival at this time, thus officially inaugurating his 2nd regnal year as king of Babylon. For ten months of his 1st regnal year, Marduk-zākir-šumi II and Marduk-apla-iddina II sat on the throne in Babylon. Thus, the two years that Babylonian Kinglist A states that Sennacherib was king of Babylon (704–703) overlap with the one month and nine months that Marduk-zākir-šumi II and Marduk-apla-iddina II sat on the throne (704) respectively. This coincides nicely with the Ptolemaic Canon, which records that the two years between the reigns of Sargon II and Bēl-ibni were “kingless.”       22  Text no. 6 line 15', text no. 15 iv 15'–v 9, text no. 16 iv 38–69, text no. 17 iii 82–iv 17, text no. 18 iii 1'–30', text no. 19 i' 15'–16', text no. 21 ii' 1'–8', text no. 22 iii 50–74, text no. 23 iii 43–65, text no. 26 i 4'b–5', text no. 28 i' 1–2, and text no. 34 lines 8b–12a.

Sennacherib’s  res gestae  imply that he came to power through his own efforts (that is, not appointed by the Assyrian or Elamite king). The fact that Sennacherib does not appear to have made an immediate attempt to remove him from power may indicate that the Assyrian king was not entirely opposed to Mušēzib-Marduk being king of Babylon. On the other hand, it may be that his attention was drawn elsewhere or that he was carefully assessing the Babylonian problem before making his next move.       26  Text no. 18 v 1'–vi 15', text no. 22 v 17–vi 35, text no. 23 v 9–vi 30, text no. 25 i 1'–12', text no. 34 lines 44b–55a, and text no. 35 lines 29'b–52'.

Inscriptions of Esarhaddon record the destruction of the city, but those accounts remove all human agency from the events.

      "text": "Campaigns to the North and Northwest         Zagros Mountain Campaign     Probably early in his 3rd regnal year (702), Sennacherib marched into the Zagros, where he attacked the Kassites and Yasubigallians living there; this expedition was officially regarded as his second campaign. [31]  The fortified city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ was captured and plundered. The insubmissive inhabitants were settled in the cities Ḫardišpu and Bīt-Kubatti and placed under the authority of the governor of Arrapḫa. Sennacherib then moved on to the land Ellipi. Ispabāra, its king, who had been a vassal of Sargon II, heard about the Assyrian advance and fled; the inscriptions do not record why Sennacherib marched against Ellipi, but it may have been because Ispabāra had thrown off Assyrian domination when Sargon died. The Assyrian army swept through the area, captured and plundered Ellipi’s principal cities (including Ṣiṣṣirtu and Kummaḫlum), and annexed part of it. The city Elenzaš was reorganized as an Assyrian center. Its name was changed to Kār-Sennacherib (“Quay of Sennacherib”) and the city was put under the authority of the governor of Ḫarḫar. On his return home, Median rulers paid tribute to him.     Expeditions to the Levant and Arabia     In modern scholarship, the best known and most widely discussed military expedition of Sennacherib is his third campaign, according to the official numbering. This is not surprising as the event is also recorded in the Bible, which describes this Assyrian king’s invasion of Judah during the reign of Hezekiah and a siege of Jerusalem. [32]  During the early years of Sennacherib’s reign, rulers in the Levant renounced allegiance to Assyria, probably with the encouragement of the Nubian rulers of Egypt, and supported those opposed to Assyrian domination, including Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) of Babylon.      In his 4th regnal year (701), Sennacherib mustered his troops and marched to the Levant. Lulî, the king of Sidon, was his first target. However, before Sennacherib’s arrival, Lulî fled, leaving the cities and towns under his control undefended. The cities Great Sidon, Lesser Sidon, Bīt-Zitti, Ṣarepta, Maḫalliba, Ušû, Akzibu, and Acco were captured. Tu-Baʾlu, a man considered loyal to Assyria, was made king of Sidon. With a large Assyrian army on the scene, several rulers in the area quickly sought to avert battle. Minuḫimmu of Samsimuruna, Abdi-Liʾti of Arwad, Uru-milki of Byblos, Mitinti of Ashdod, Būdi-il of Bīt-Ammon, Kammūsu-nadbi of Moab, and Aya-rāmu of Edom all brought gifts and tribute before Sennacherib. The bribes worked. However, not everyone was as easily cowed into submission.     Ṣidqâ of the city Ashkelon, the nobles and citizens of the city Ekron, and Hezekiah of Judah fought back. Ṣidqâ’s efforts failed. Ashkelon along with the other cities under his authority fell to the Assyrians and he together with his family was captured and deported. Sennacherib put Šarru-lū-dāri, the son of a former ruler (Rūkibtu), on the throne of Ashkelon. The nobles and citizens of Ekron — who had deposed Padî, their pro-Assyrian king, and who had handed him over to Hezekiah — became frightened and sought military support from Egypt and its Nubian rulers. The Assyrian army met the Egyptian-led coalition at the city Eltekeh and routed it. Eltekeh and the city Tamnâ were besieged, captured, and plundered, and the anti-Assyrian elements at Ekron were put to death; corpses were hung from the towers of the wall as a warning to anyone who thought of rebelling against Assyria. The turn of events must have taken Hezekiah of Judah by surprise, as he released Padî; Sennacherib returned Padî to his rightful place as ruler of Ekron.    The kingdom of Judah put up a good fight against the Assyrians, but it too suffered a heavy defeat. Sennacherib boasts that he captured forty-six Judean cities, including Lachish, which fell after an intensive siege. [33]  Hezekiah and his elite forces were confined to Jerusalem, where the Judean is said to have been caged like a bird. The defenses of Jerusalem held, however, and the Assyrians returned home without taking the city. Before departing, Hezekiah appears to have struck a deal with Sennacherib, for he sent a substantial payment to Nineveh in exchange for remaining in power (as an Assyrian vassal). The Levant, having witnessed firsthand the might of Assyria, did not rebel again. [34]     In his 15th regnal year (690), possibly while Babylon was under siege, Sennacherib marched into the north Arabian desert against Teʾelḫunu, queen of the Arabs, and Hazael. [35]  The city Adummatu (biblical Dumah, mod. Dūmat al-Jandal) and another city (name not preserved) were besieged and plundered. According to later sources, Teʾelḫunu was carried off to Assyria.       Campaigns to the North and Northwest    Sennacherib directed his attention to the north and northwest with a series of campaigns during his 8th (697), 9th (696), and 10th (695) regnal years. [36]  The king personally led the first of these, but stayed at home for the other two. During his fifth campaign (697), according to the official numbering, Sennacherib attacked the inhabitants of cities located on and near Mount Nipur (mod. Judi Dagh). [37]  The victories were hard earned, as the Assyrian army was not well trained in marching through and fighting in difficult, narrow mountain terrain. Official reports, including those inscribed on several rock faces in that region, record the difficulties encountered. After the Mount Nipur area was brought into submission, Sennacherib set his sights on Maniye, king of the city Ukku. As the Assyrian army approached Ukku, Maniye is reported to have abandoned the city and fled to a remote location. Ukku and thirty-three cities in its vicinity are said to have been captured, plundered, and subsequently destroyed.     In his 9th (696) and 10th (695) regnal years, Sennacherib sent expeditions to Anatolia. These campaigns were led by his officials. [38]  His reluctance to personally go on these campaigns was likely rooted in the fact that Sargon II had been killed there and that his body had never been recovered. In 696, Assyrian troops were sent to Ḫilakku (Cilicia), where Kirūa, the city ruler of Illubru, had incited rebellion and blocked the road to the land Que. It has been suggested that Que may have been once again friendly towards Assyria and possibly a vassal state, and the purpose of the campaign was to assist that pro-Assyrian area. The rebel cities Illubru, Ingirâ, and Tarsus were besieged, captured, and plundered. Kirūa was captured and brought back to Nineveh, where he was flayed publicly. The next year (695), Sennacherib sent his army to the land Tabal, where Gurdî, the city ruler of Urdutu (and possibly the man responsible for Sargon II’s death), had taken up arms against Assyria. Only the city Tīl-Garimme is reported to have been captured and destroyed. The campaign was far from successful, since the chief instigator remained at large.

This event is also recorded in the Bible (2 Kings 18:13–19:36; Isaiah 36:1–37:37; and 2 Chronicles 32:1–22) and classical sources (Herodotus, Hist. 2 141–142; and Josephus,  Ant. Jud.  X 1–23).

Archaeological excavations at Lachish confirm that the city did in fact succumb to an Assyrian siege. See Ussishkin, Conquest of Lachish for a detailed study of the relief and the archaeological evidence.        34  What happened in the Levant between 688 and 681 is unclear as there are very few extant inscriptions of Sennacherib for the post-689 period. It has been suggested that Judah rebelled a second time during this period. For the opinion that Sennacherib campaigned twice to the Levant, once in 701 and again after 689, see Shea, JBL 104 (1985) pp. 401–418; Grayson, JSSEA 11 (1981) pp. 85–88; and Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 110–111. This issue falls outside the scope of this volume and thus it will not be examined here.        35  Text no. 35 lines 53'–9''. This event is also recorded in inscriptions of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. See for example Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 19 Esarhaddon 1 iv 1–5 and p. 30 Esarhaddon 2 ii 46–50; and Borger, BIWA pp. 69–70 K 3087 // K 3405 // Rm 2,558 lines 1b–4 (and 12). Teʾelḫunu is called Apkallatu in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon. As R. Borger (Orientalia NS 26 [1957] pp. 9–10) has already pointed out, Apkallatu is not a proper name, but rather a title which Esarhaddon’s scribes mistook as a personal name, and thus Apkallatu is the same woman as Teʾelḫunu. For studies, see Ephʿal, Arabs pp. 118–125; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 112–113; and Frahm, Sanherib p. 16.        36  The Eponym Chronicle records for his 1st regnal year (704) that officials of the king were sent against the Kulummians in Tabal to avenge his father’s death. Because the text is badly damaged, the outcome of the campaign is not known. E. Frahm (PNA 3/1 p. 1118 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība II.3b-2') suggests that the expedition was probably not a great success since it was not mentioned in Sennacherib’s royal inscriptions.        37  Text no. 16 iv 70–v 32, text no. 17 iv 18–60, text no. 18 iii 1''–iv 10, text no. 19 ii' 1'–13'a, text no. 22 iii 75–iv 31, text no. 23 iii 66–iv 25, text no. 26 i 14'–17', and text no. 34 lines 16–17a.

The  Babyloniaca  of Berossus (Burstein, SANE 1/5 [1978] p. 24) also records events of the 696 campaign. Relying on Abydenus and Polyhistor, Berossus states that the Assyrians defeated a group of Ionian warships. Polyhistor states that Sennacherib left an inscribed stele on the battlefield and that he built (rebuilt?) the city Tarsus. Abydenus records that he built (rebuilt?) the temple of Sandes (= Heracles) and that he built (rebuilt?) the city Tarsus.

      "text": "Walls of Nineveh and Their Gates        Numerous texts describe Sennacherib’s renovation and expansion of Nineveh, a city that he transformed into the leading metropolis of Assyria. He began projects there almost immediately after he became king; the labor was provided by prisoners of war, including Chaldeans, Arameans, Manneans, and the inhabitants of Que, Ḫilakku, Philistia, and Tyre. For general studies, see in particular Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 113–116; Frahm, Sanherib pp. 265–276 and passim; Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) pp. 389–433, esp. §§11, 13.1, 13.5–6, 14.2–3, 15.2, 15.4, and 15.8; Frahm, PNA 3/1 pp. 1121–1122 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība II.3c-1'; and Frahm, RLA 12/1–2 (2009) p. 19 §6.1.1–8. For a detailed and comprehensive study of the “Palace Without a Rival,” see J.M. Russell, Senn.’s Palace. Only the projects recorded in texts edited in this volume will be discussed here.        Egalzagdinutukua: The “Palace Without a Rival”     One of this king’s most ambitious projects was the construction of his royal residence and progress on its construction can be followed in texts inscribed on clay cylinders, clay prisms, and stone bull colossi between 702 and 691. [39]  This once-magnificent palace, which he gave the Sumerian ceremonial name Egalzagdinutukua (the “Palace Without a Rival”), has only been partially excavated. The royal residence, which is on the larger of the two Nineveh mounds, Kuyunjik, is also referred to as the South-West Palace, as it is located on the southwest part of the citadel.      Early in his reign, Sennacherib razed the former palace, diverted the Tebilti River (which is reported to have flooded the area around the palace and to have eroded the previous brickwork), made a large tract of land (including areas previously underwater) suitable for building, laid the foundations of a massive mud-brick terrace, and began construction of the terrace upon which his palace would be built. The site of the previous palace was enlarged by 340×288 cubits (ca. 187×158 m). A high terrace was constructed on water-proofed stone foundations. Originally the terrace was raised 160 courses of brick, but it was later raised to a final height of 190 courses of brick.      The palace, which grew in size every year, was sumptuously decorated with various types of wood, stone, and metal. Its palatial halls were roofed with beams of cedar and cypress from Mounts Lebanon and Sirāra. Tall metal-banded door leaves were hung in their gateways. Some of the rooms were decorated with glazed baked bricks. Like his predecessors, Sennacherib had numerous apotropaic colossi stationed in principal gateways and had the walls of many rooms and halls lined with sculpted limestone slabs, many of which were unearthed in the mid-nineteenth century. A.H. Layard described these orthostats as “two miles of bas-relief” and Sîn-šarra-iškun, Sennacherib’s fourth successor, referred to this building as “the palace of alabaster.” [40]  Unlike his forefathers, Sennacherib had colossi cast from bronze and copper using a metalworking technique he claims to have perfected. In total, he claims to have set up in the palace’s gateways twelve copper bulls, two alabaster bulls, and seventy-two bulls and sphinxes of white limestone, stone laboriously hauled from the city Balāṭāya.      A striking feature of the palace described in the texts was an elaborate pillared portico, a  bīt-appāte  (a  bīt-ḫilāni  in the “Amorite tongue”) that was modeled on a feature of Hittite palaces. This section included twelve striding lion colossi of bronze, which served as bases for four cedar and two copper columns. Twenty-two copper sphinxes and ten alabaster sphinxes were also used as bases for wooden columns decorated with metal inlay, but it is not clear from reports of this project where in the palace these were set up.      Between 694 and late 691, Sennacherib appears to have put the finishing touches on the “Palace Without a Rival.” In 694, the (final?) dimensions are reported to have been 914×440 cubits (ca. 503×242 m). In 691, Sennacherib boasted that Egalzagdinutukua had been completed. [41]         Walls of Nineveh and Their Gates    Inscriptions dating from 699 to 691 commemorate one of Sennacherib’s most ambitious building enterprises: the construction of Nineveh’s walls. Sennacherib states that the former circumference of the city was 9,300 cubits and that no previous ruler had built an inner or outer wall for the city. He boasts of expanding Nineveh’s circumference by 12,515 cubits, expanding the length of the city walls to a total of 21,815 cubits, and of building the outer defenses in two parts: (1) the main (or great) inner wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu (“Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies”), constructed with limestone foundations and built to a height of 180 (later 200) courses of brick and to a width of 40 bricks; and (2) an outer stone wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa (“Wall, Terrorizer of Enemies”), whose foundations were 45  nindanu  deep. [42]     Sennacherib initially states that the city wall had fourteen gates (697–695), but later records that it had fifteen (694), and then eighteen (691) gates. [43]  Clearly, the plan evolved over time. The gates are listed counterclockwise as follows:       Gate      Text nos. 15–16 (697–695)       Text no. 17 (694)       Text no. 18 (691)       I    1.

Of course, this is just royal rhetoric as it would have been impossible for Sennacherib to have completed such a large-scale project in such a short time.

Bricks, stone slabs, and stone blocks attest to this project; see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 141–142 T 75–80a. Nearly the entire city wall is still visible today, as a high mound or as a modern reconstruction. Excavations near the Šamaš Gate and the Ea Gate reveal that the inner wall was ca. 15–16 m wide, a figure consistent with the thickness of forty bricks; Reade (RLA 9/5–6 [2000] pp. 399–400 §11.3) suggests that the inner wall was approximately 25 m high. The outer, stone wall was ca. 11 m thick and ca. 4.5 m high. BM 124938, a relief depicting Nineveh, shows the city walls Badnigalbilukurašušu and Badnigerimḫuluḫa.

      "text": "The City Squares and Streets, and the Royal Road     The Moat     The Citadel Wall     The Citadel Temples     The Armory     A New Akītu-house     Other Projects at Nineveh        Botanical Gardens, Swamps, and Related Waterworks    Sennacherib created a large botanical garden beside his palace, which he claims was a “replica of Mount Amanus,” and he planted a large variety of trees in it. [44]  In addition, he provided the citizens of Nineveh with numerous garden plots that were planted on newly tilled soil, and created a park and a game preserve beside the city. [45]  Those gardens and parks required much water and the king devoted a great deal of time and effort to providing irrigation water for those areas and regulating the flow of that water.      Early in his reign (ca. 702–700), Sennacherib diverted water from the Ḫusur River (mod. Khosr), near the city Kisiru, for a distance of one and a half leagues to the plain of Nineveh. [46]  To control the flow and to carry off excess water during the flood season, a large wet marsh was created east of the city wall (ca. 699). [47]  The area was stocked with flora and fauna of the Babylonian marshes and populated with migratory birds (herons), wild pigs, roe deer, and other animals. Sometime between 700 and 694, a more substantial irrigation system was needed and the requisite water was found in mountain springs northeast of the city, near Mount Muṣri and the cities Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, and Sulu. Three new canals were dug to the Ḫusur River, where their waters supplemented those of the river, thus making it possible to irrigate fields upstream and downstream of Nineveh all year long. [48]  Throughout the rest of his reign, Sennacherib continued his extensive waterworks program, creating at least sixteen canals that brought a constant supply of water to Nineveh. [49]         Bridges and Aqueducts   Sennacherib built a bridge paved with limestone opposite a gate of the citadel in order to facilitate access to the citadel from the lower town; the Ḫusur River flows between the royal road and the citadel, thus preventing direct access to the upper town from the southeast. [50]  A second bridge was built downstream, but its precise location is not indicated in the texts. To control the flow of the waters of the Ḫusur River, Sennacherib had aqueducts built. [51]  Work on one of the bridges and on the aqueducts is first attested in 700 and 699 respectively.        The City Squares and Streets, and the Royal Road   Throughout his reign, Sennacherib boasts that he broadened the squares, streets, and alleys of Nineveh, thus brightening the city. [52]  As part of his transformation of the lower town, Sennacherib created a fifty-two-cubit-wide royal road that ran through the city. That road may have run north from the Aššur Gate in the south wall, east past the armory and the citadel, to the Sîn Gate (formerly the Gate of the Gardens) at the western end of the north wall. [53]  To prevent future encroachment, he erected inscribed and sculpted steles on both sides of the roadway. Reports of that project are known from texts composed ca. 693–691.       The Moat   In inscriptions composed ca. 693–691, Sennacherib boasts of widening Nineveh’s moat to a width of one hundred large cubits. [54]      The Citadel Wall   Very little is known about work on the citadel wall since few contemporary texts refer to its rebuilding; Ashurbanipal credits Sennacherib as a previous builder, but does not describe his grandfather’s work. [55]  Sennacherib claims to have raised its summit as high as a mountain and to have reinforced its base with limestone. As part of the renovations, its gates were presumably rebuilt; at least one gate is mentioned as being opposite a bridge that crossed over the Ḫusur River. Work on the citadel wall was in progress in 699.       The Citadel Temples   Early in his reign (ca. 702), Sennacherib sponsored the renovation of several temples in Nineveh’s citadel. Among these were the temples of Sîn, Ningal, Šamaš, Aya, and the Lady of Nineveh (= Ištar/Mullissu). [56]  Sennacherib also renovated a shrine of the god Ḫaya (the god of scribes), but it is uncertain whether this sanctuary was part of the Nabû temple Ezida (“True House”) or was located elsewhere (possibly in Aššur). [57]         The Armory    After the completion of the “Palace Without a Rival,” or shortly before work on that palace was finished, Sennacherib began rebuilding and enlarging the armory, a large building south of the citadel and next to the western city wall that he referred to as the “Rear Palace” ( ekal kutalli ) and occasionally as the “Review Palace” ( ekal māšarti ). [58]  The work may have begun in 691, as suggested by the earliest known sources for that project, and probably continued for several years, at least until 688 or 687. [59]  Sennacherib razed the former armory — which he complained was too small, poorly constructed, and dilapidated — made fallow land in its vicinity suitable for building, and constructed its replacement on a high brick terrace. The new “Rear Palace” comprised two wings and a large outer courtyard. One wing was built in the Syrian style, while another was built in the Assyrian style. Timber for its roof and doors was supplied by kings of Amurru (the West). Bull colossi, sculpted from white limestone hewn in the region of the city Balāṭāya, were stationed in its gateways. Statues of sphinxes bore cedar columns; other monumental bronze protective figures (including  lamassu s) and decorative elements adorned its rooms and gates. The outer courtyard was designed so that horses and other animals could be exercised there. In addition, Sennacherib had a structure with four copper pillars and a cedar roof constructed; this may have been the very spot where the king sat when reviewing troops and animals, tribute, and prisoners.       A New  Akītu -house   Sennacherib had a new  akītu -house built to the north of the Nergal Gate (ca. 690). [60]  Ešaḫulezenzagmukam (“House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year”) was intended to replace the existing  akītu -house, which after the completion of the new city wall was now situated inside Nineveh. The new temple was probably constructed in connection with his religious reforms. It is possible that this project was abandoned before its completion. [61]  Sometime after the destruction of Babylon in 689, Sennacherib may have decided to construct another  akītu -house for the god Aššur in the outskirts of Aššur; this may explain why Ashurbanipal rebuilt the former, original  akītu -house, and not Ešaḫulezenzagmukam.        Other Projects at Nineveh   Prism fragments (text no. 33) discovered in a palatial building excavated about 600 m northeast of Nebi Yunus attest to another project of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Since those inscriptions have not yet been published, we do not know the function of that building.

Reade (RLA 9/5–6 [2000] p. 406 §11.7) proposes that the Ḫusur valley east of the city wall, where there were massive dams, was an appropriate location for the creation of a marsh, noting that the river was controlled by one well-preserved dam just below al-Ǧīla, at least two more upstream of Nineveh’s wall, and another dam at the city wall.       48  Text no. 17 viii 31–42.       49  Text no. 18 viii 6'–12' records the digging of several new canals near/from the cities Girmua and Ālum-labir.

The discovery of paving stones midway between the Nergal Gate and the northern end of the citadel may be evidence for the royal road north of the citadel mound. S. Lumsden (ICAANE Proceedings 1 pp. 817–818 and p. 825 fig. 1), based on his work in the lower town in 1989–90 (Lumsden, Mar Šipri 4 [1991] pp. 1–3; and Stronach and Lumsden, BiAr 55 [1992] p. 229), proposes that the royal road ran north to the Nergal Gate, and not northwest to the Sîn Gate. He also proposes that such a road would have entered the city from the east, through the Šamaš Gate, Nineveh’s largest city gate.       54  Text no. 18 vii 19b–22 and text no. 38 lines 18–19a. The moat is clearly visible only on the northern and eastern sides of Nineveh, about 80 m outside of the city wall. It is 70 m wide and 10 m deep (after erosion). A relief from the South-West Palace (Layard, Discoveries p. 231) may show the southwestern corner of the wall with the moat. See Frahm, Sanherib p. 99 and Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) p. 390 fig. 1 and p. 400 fig. 5.       55  The concluding formulae of text no. 7 and K 2662+ (Frahm, Sanherib p. 198) mention the citadel wall. Text no. 18 vii 11b–19a may describe its rebuilding. For the Ashurbanipal inscriptions, see Borger, BIWA p. 118 Prism D viii 64–75 and p. 183 Prism E Stück 18 lines 4–8. BM 124938, a relief depicting Nineveh, shows the city walls of Nineveh, including the citadel wall.

Because the building report of this inscription is badly damaged, it is not possible to determine with certainty how many temples Sennacherib claims to have rebuilt in this text. It is possible that this inscription recorded the renovation of four, five, or even six different temples, all of which are said to have been built/renovated by Ashurnasirpal II (883–859). E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 107 and 273) raises the possibility that Sennacherib may have worked on the Sebetti temple ca. 688, but this is not certain. For further information, see the commentary to text no. 24 and the on-page note to vi 17'–18' of that inscription.       57  Text no. 10 lines 11–19.        58  Text no. 22 vi 36–73a, text no. 23 vi 31–53a, text no. 25 ii' 1'–12', text no. 34 lines 55b–90, and probably text no. 35 lines 10''–15''. The building, which is buried within the small mound now called Nebi Yunus (“Prophet Jonah”), has an important Muslim shrine on top of it and therefore has not been fully explored or excavated. According to tradition, as the name of the mound suggests, Jonah was buried there; when the tomb of Ḥnanīšō was opened in 1349, the body inside was identified as that prophet. Parts of the site, mostly along the edges of the mound, however, have been exposed and explored. For finds in this area (with references to previous literature), see Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) pp. 419–420 §15.2. Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal continued work on the armory. For descriptions of their work, see Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 22–25 Esarhaddon 1 v 40–vi 43 and pp. 33–34 Esarhaddon 2 iv 32–vi 9; and Borger, BIWA p. 117 Prism B viii 64–72 and p. 163 Prism C x 88–97.       59  We are unable to accurately estimate the length of time it took to rebuild the armory since there is a general lack of extant inscriptions from Nineveh after Sennacherib’s 17th regnal year (688). This project may have been completed ca. 688/687, finished several years after that (ca. 686–684), or may have been unfinished at the time of his death in 681.       60  Text no. 37.

The Mesopotamian month names and their modern equivalents are:         I    Nisannu   March–April   VII    Tašrītu   September–October       II    Ayyāru   April–May   VIII    Araḫsamna   October–November       III    Simānu   May–June   IX    Kislīmu   November–December       IV    Duʾūzu   June–July   X    Ṭebētu, Kinūnu   December–January       V    Abu   July–August   XI    Šabāṭu   January–February       VI    Ulūlu   August–September   XII    Addaru   February–March       VI₂    Intercalary Ulūlu     XII₂    Intercalary Addaru         Unless it is stated otherwise, the dates given in this volume (excluding those in bibliographical citations) are all BC. Each ancient Mesopotamian year has been given a single Julian year equivalent even though the ancient year actually encompassed parts of two Julian years, with the ancient year beginning around the time of the vernal equinox. Thus, for example, the 3rd regnal year of Sennacherib (the eponymy of Nabû-lēʾi) is indicated to be 702, although it actually ended in early 701 and thus events which took place late in the ancient year “702” actually took place early in the Julian year 701.     Several exemplars of text no. 2 and text no. 3 are dated according to the Elamite month Sibūti, the seventh month of the Elamite calendar. At this time, we cannot offer a satisfactory explanation why Sennacherib’s (and later Esarhaddon’s) scribes dated some texts by Elamite months rather than Mesopotamian ones."

Recently, M. Valério (Journal of Language Relationship 6 [2011] pp. 173–183) has argued that the Semitic name of Mitanni (Ḫanigalbat) should be read as Ḫani-Rabbat, a West-Semitic (Amorite) name meaning “Great Ḫani.” If this understanding of the name is correct, then one should read BALA  ḫa-bi-gal  as BALA  ḫa-bi- GAL “Habi-rabbat dynasty.” As pointed out by G. Frame (RIMB 2 pp. 90–91), it is unclear why some Assyrian kings are given dynastic affiliation (Sennacherib and Aššur-nādin-šumi to the Ḫabigal [Ḫanigalbat] dynasty, and Shalmaneser V to the Baltil dynasty) while others are not (Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, and Esarhaddon). It is also curious that King List A describes Marduk-apla-iddina II during his first regnal period (721–710) as being from the Sealand dynasty (KUR  tam -( tim )), but as a soldier of Ḫabi (Ḫanigalbat) during his second regnal period (703).       63  J.A. Brinkman (Studies Oppenheim pp. 24–25 n. 137 and RLA 7/5–6 [1989] p. 379) proposes that Marduk-zākir-šumi II is likely to be identified with a provincial governor of this name who is said to have been the son (or descendant) of Arad-Ea and who appeared as a witness in a kudurru composed at Babylon in 715 (Messerschmidt and Ungnad, VAS 1 no. 37 v 2–3).       64  For the interpretation that BALA E may refer to the Babylon Dynasty, see Brinkman, PKB pp. 166–171."

Kudur-(Naḫḫunte) ruled the land Elam for ten months. (Ḫumban)-nimena ascended the throne in the land Elam.    iii 16b–18)     In an unknown year, (Ḫumban)-nimena mustered the troops of the land Elam (and) Akkad and at the city Ḫalulê he fought against Assyria (var. the army of Assyria).

This inscription includes a short prologue, a lengthy and detailed account of the king’s first campaign (late 704–early 702), which was directed against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and his Chaldean and Elamite allies in Babylonia, and a building report describing the large-scale renovations of the “Palace Without a Rival” (the South-West Palace) and various other public works at Nineveh, including the creation of a botanical garden. Although none of the cylinders inscribed with this text are dated, the inscription was probably written early in 702 (Sennacherib’s 3rd regnal year). In lieu of a date, the scribe indicated the total number of lines; each copy was inscribed with ninety-four lines of text.

Two versions of the text are presently known. The first is written on cylinders discovered at Aššur and Nineveh, and the second is inscribed on two cylinders found at Tarbiṣu. The prologues and accounts of military narration of both editions are identical (with minor variants), but the building reports deviate: those from Aššur and Nineveh record work undertaken at Nineveh, while those from Tarbiṣu describe the rebuilding of Egalmeslam, the temple of the god Nergal in that city. For this reason, the Tarbiṣu cylinders are edited on their own, in Part 2 (with the other Tarbiṣu inscriptions). That text, however, is used in the reconstruction of the damaged passages in lines 1–62. E. Frahm has suggested that the talented scribe Nabû-zuqup-kēnu was the author of this inscription. For the evidence, see Frahm, ISIMU 6 (2003) pp. 157–160. For other biographical information on Nabû-zuqup-kēnu, see Baker and Pearce, PNA 2/2 pp. 912–913.   Sennacherib’s cylinder inscriptions fall into two broad categories: (1) foundation inscriptions with annalistic accounts (text nos. 1–9) and (2) foundation inscriptions with no military narration; these correspond to Grayson’s IA1 (and IA2) and IB1 categories respectively (Orientalia NS 49 [1980] pp. 150–153). The first type, the group to which this text belongs, represents the most common type of text attested on clay cylinders from the reign of Sennacherib, while the second type is far less commonly attested. The inscriptions with annalistic narration were inscribed on cylinders deposited in the structure of Egalzagdinutukua (the “Palace Without a Rival”), located in the southwest corner of Kuyunjik, in the structure of the citadel wall, and in the structure of Nineveh’s new wall (Badnigalbilukurašušu, “Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies”); at Tarbiṣu, they were deposited in the structure of Egalmeslam. Texts without military narration were probably all written on clay cylinders deposited in the structure of a temple.   There are numerous fragments of clay cylinders inscribed with annalistic accounts and reports of construction of the king’s palace. Almost all of these, with a few exceptions (text nos. 5–9), are duplicates of text nos. 1–4. The attribution of many of the fragments can be determined with certainty because there is sufficient textual variation in the content of those four inscriptions; in some cases, especially with text no. 4, line divisions can aid in the attribution of some of the pieces (because each copy of text no. 4 divides the inscription in the exact same manner). Nevertheless, there are a few tiny fragments whose precise identification still remains uncertain. This is particularly true when trying to distinguish some of the small fragments inscribed with text no. 3 and text no. 4. Exemplars whose attribution is not certain have an asterisk (*) following the exemplar number, for example exs. 1* and 2* of this inscription, and these exemplars are listed in a separate catalogue (Catalogue of Uncertain Exemplars), beneath the main catalogue. Assuming ex. 1* is not inscribed with a copy of this text, then that fragment could preserve lines 1–5 of text no. 2, text no. 3, or text no. 4. Ex. 2* is likely an exemplar of this text (rather than of text nos. 2–4), but its attribution is a bit uncertain because there are only traces of signs in lines 1'–6' and 13' and because the readings of several of the signs in lines 7'–12' are not entirely certain.   The provenance of ex. 1 is not known, but according to records in the British Museum this cylinder was purchased from I. Géjou. S. Smith (Senn. p. 2) proposed that it came from the same location as BM 103000 (text no. 17 ex. 1), which E.A.W. Budge (By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 23) states “was found in a chamber built in the wall (or perhaps it was sunk in the actual wall), close to one of the human-headed bulls of one of the gates of Nineveh, and the bull near which it was placed must have been removed before it could be extracted from the wall.” Although the building report describes work on Sennacherib’s “Palace Without a Rival,” it should not be assumed that ex. 1 was deposited in the structure of that building because several clay prisms and cylinders containing building reports recording work performed at Nineveh (for example, ex. 11) were discovered at Aššur. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 42 and ISIMU 6 [2003] p. 131) tentatively suggests the possibility that ex. 1 originates from Area SH, an area located north of Kuyunjik and close to the western wall, and a location at which many inscribed cylinders and prisms were found or are thought to have been discovered.   Ex. 2 (Ki 1902-5-10,1) may have been picked up by a guard in Area SH; see Frahm, ISIMU 6 (2003) p. 132. Based on their museum number, exs. 3, 6, 8, and 10 could come from the same cylinder, but without any physical joins. R. Borger (BAL 2  p. 64) listed Th 1905-4-9,64 as an exemplar of this text, but that fragment is an exemplar of text no. 4 and is therefore edited with that inscription.   The master text is ex. 1, with some restorations from exs. 2, 4, 6–7, and 11; line 95 is a conflation of exs. 1 and 6. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. The damaged passages in lines 5–15 are restored from the two cylinders discovered at Tarbiṣu. For a combined score of lines 1–62 of the Nineveh and Tarbiṣu recensions of the “First Campaign Cylinder,” with detailed textual commentary, see the edition in Frahm, ISIMU 6 (2003) pp. 134–151.

This foundation inscription with annalistic narration includes a short prologue, an abbreviated report of Sennacherib’s first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II and his Chaldean and Elamite allies), an account of his second campaign (a military expedition against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi), and a building report describing the large-scale renovations of the “Palace Without a Rival” (the South-West Palace) and various other public works at Nineveh, including the creation of a botanical garden. Two of the exemplars preserve a date and both were inscribed in the second half of the eponymy of Nabû-lēʾi, governor of the city Arbela (702); copies of text no. 3 were made at the same time. In addition, the scribe indicated the total number of lines; each copy was inscribed with seventy-one lines of text.

Despite the fact that some copies were written at the same time as the following text, this inscription was probably composed shortly before text no. 3. This is suggested by the fact that it duplicates text found in text no. 1. Note that the extant copies of both text nos. 2 and 3 were inscribed in the Elamite month Sibūti, the seventh month in the Elamite calendar and the equivalent of Araḫsamna (VIII). See the on-page note to line 72 for further information on the use of Elamite months in the dating of Assyrian royal inscriptions. As E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 46) has pointed out, two inscriptions were simultaneously in circulation during the second half of 702: text no. 2 and text no. 3.   E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 45–46) proposed the non-physical join between Rm 2,95+ and BM 123412 since the surface of both pieces is very worn in exactly the same manner (thus making the inscription difficult to read) and since at least one piece of each sub-exemplar was discovered by R.C. Thompson in the vicinity of the Ištar temple at Nineveh. After careful re-examination of the fragments in the British Museum, Frahm’s conjectured join is accepted here. Frahm also raises the possibility that exs. 2 and 3 come from the same cylinder. J.A. Brinkman kindly re-examined A 16937 and A 16940 and he could not find any convincing evidence to support a view that these fragments could not belong to one and the same cylinder; Brinkman notes that the height of the signs, the vertical spacing between the lines, and the curvature are roughly the same on both fragments. Since the non-physical join between exs. 2 and 3 is tentative, it is best to edit them individually.   In addition to the three certain exemplars of this inscription, there are thirteen cylinder fragments that may preserve copies of this text. These are edited as text no. 1 ex. 1* and text no. 3 exs. 1*–12*. See the catalogues and commentaries of those texts for further details.   The master text of lines 1–50 and 59–71 is ex. 1, with some restorations from exs. 2 and 3, and that of lines 51–58 is ex. 3. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. The restorations in lines 1–56 are are based on text no. 3 and those in lines 57–71 are based on text no. 1. Note that lines 34–43 also duplicate text no. 1 lines 63–72.

The prologue and military narration (which contains accounts of Sennacherib’s first two campaigns) are identical to the previous inscription (with one minor omission and minor orthographic variations). The building report, however, deviates from that text, as it omits the passage recording the roofing of the palace, the construction of an ornate portico (a  bīt-ḫilāni ), and the lining of the walls of the palace with sculpted orthostats, as well as the passage stating that the gods were invited into the “Palace Without a Rival” upon its completion. The complete cylinder (ex. 1) was inscribed at the same time as several copies of text no. 2, in the second half of the eponymy of Nabû-lēʾi, governor of the city Arbela (702). The scribe also indicated the total number of lines; each copy was inscribed with sixty-three lines of text. The inscription is commonly referred to as the “Bellino Cylinder.” The name derives from Karl Bellino’s hand-drawn facsimile of the complete cylinder (ex. 1) that C.J. Rich, the Resident in Baghdad for the East India Company, purchased at Nineveh in 1820; that copy was published in 1850 by G.F. Grotefend, who had received the copy in 1820 (just before Bellino died).

Rich visited Mosul and acquired what he described as “a small earthen vase covered with cuneiform writing” (= ex. 1). Shortly thereafter, K. Bellino, his secretary, made a facsimile of the text, which he sent to G.F. Grotefend, a man who by that time had already made several breakthroughs in the decipherment of Persian cuneiform. Thirty years later, Grotefend published Bellino’s copy in Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Hist.-phil. Klasse 4 (after p. 206). As for the cylinder itself, Rich brought it back to England. In 1825, Mrs. Rich sold it, along with numerous other objects and manuscripts, to the British Museum. Those purchased objects formed the “R[ich]” collection; for details on the R[ich] collection, see Stolper, Studies Larsen pp. 516–517 and Reade in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 108.   An old, yellow paper label attached to ex. 1 states that the clay cylinder was “From Nineveh.” E.A.W. Budge (By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 25) and others (Frahm, Sanherib pp. 29 and 46) have suggested that the piece originates from Nebi Yunus, where locals had already dug deep into the mound, exposing the foundation of a palace of Sennacherib there. Ex. 1*, which also is part of the R[ich] collection, may have been acquired at the same time as ex. 1, in 1820, and may come from a similar provenance as the complete cylinder (ex. 1). Exs. 7* and 11*–12*, however, do not come from Nineveh, but originate from Aššur.   In addition to the three certain exemplars of this inscription, there are fourteen cylinder fragments that may preserve copies of the “Bellino Cylinder” (best preserved on ex. 1). These are edited as exs. 1*–13* and as text no. 1 ex. 1*. For text no. 1 ex. 1*, see the commentary to that inscription.   Exs. 1*–12*, all of which preserve parts of lines 1–56, are duplicates of either the “Bellino Cylinder” (ex. 1) or text no. 2 since both inscriptions are near duplicates up to line 56, at which point the texts deviate. Ex. 1* may preserve lines 1–11 of text no. 2, but since it does not add  re-ṣi-šú  (“his ally”) after ELAM.MA.KI (“Elam”) in line 5, that fragment is more likely an exemplar of this text. Should exs. 2*–12* be exemplars of text no. 2, then those fragments would preserve the following lines of that inscription: ex. 2* contains parts of lines 7–26; ex. 3* has parts of lines 12–23; ex. 4* preserves parts of lines 21–27; ex. 5* is inscribed with parts of lines 26–32; ex. 6* contains parts of lines 28–48; ex. 7* has parts of lines 33–44; ex. 8* preserves parts of lines 35–44; ex. 9* is inscribed with parts of lines 39–48; ex. 10* contains parts of lines 43–56; ex. 11* has parts of lines 17–27; and ex. 12* is inscribed with parts of lines 37–57.   Ex. 13* may be a duplicate of either text no. 3 or text no. 4. Should that fragment be an exemplar of the latter text, then it preserves parts of lines 83–88.   It is uncertain how long this inscription was in circulation since only ex. 1 has a date preserved on it. It is possible that this inscription was also inscribed on clay cylinders during the eponymy of Ḫanānu, governor of the city Tīl-Barsip (701); note that all of the known copies of text no. 4 that preserve a date were inscribed in the first part of the eponymy of Mitūnu (700).   The master text is ex. 1, with some minor improvements from the other exemplars. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. The scribe of ex. 1 marked every tenth line with a winkelhaken on the left edge; line counts also appear on several exemplars of text no. 4.

The prologue, the accounts of the first and second campaigns, and the building report are similar to those of text no. 3. This inscription also includes the earliest known account of his third campaign, during which he marched to the Levant, where he collected gifts and tribute from eight kings, deposed Ṣidqâ of Sidon and replaced him with a pro-Assyrian ruler (Šarru-lū-dāri), defeated an Egyptian-led coalition that had been organized by the nobles and citizens of the city Ekron, reinstalled Padî as king of Ekron, captured numerous cities belonging to the Judean king Hezekiah, and laid siege to Jerusalem (but without capturing the city). Some of the events in Judah are also described in the Bible (2 Kings 18:13–19:36 and 2 Chronicles 32:1–22). The military narration concludes with a boast about Hezekiah sending a substantial payment to Nineveh and a short passage stating that Sennacherib formed a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers from prisoners deported from conquered lands. Several exemplars preserve a date and these were inscribed at the beginning of the eponymy of Mitūnu, governor of the city Isāna (700). In addition, the scribe indicated the total number of lines; each copy was inscribed with ninety-four lines of text. The inscription is commonly referred to as the “Rassam Cylinder,” being named after Hormuzd Rassam, who discovered several complete copies (exs. 1–5) in the ruins of the South-West Palace. In older literature, this inscription is also referred to as “Cylinder B.”    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003478/]  or the  score

inscription are more or less borrowed directly from text no. 3, but with some omissions and additions, and the occasional substitution of words; most of text no. 3 is copied from text no. 2, which in turn borrows some of its content from text no. 1. The report of the third campaign, however, appears to have been composed anew for this inscription. Close examination of text nos. 1–4, as well as of inscriptions written on clay prisms between 697 and 691/689 (text nos. 15–18 and 22–23), provides valuable insight into some of the editorial practices of scribes used in the composition of this king’s  res gestae ; omissions, additions, and substitutions can be easily tracked from one edition to the next. This volume, however, is not the venue for a complete and thorough examination of the editorial history of Sennacherib’s foundation inscriptions. Some of the more significant changes are noted in the on-page notes of text nos. 1–4, 15–18, and 22–23. For further information about Sennacherib’s foundation inscriptions that were written on clay cylinders, see the commentary of text no. 1.   Ex. 32 (BM 134451) may have been inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni (699) since a horizontal ruling separates the reports of the second and third campaigns (after line 8'). Ruling lines appear to have been used for the first time in texts inscribed in 699 (Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year); see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 49 (ex. HHH) and 61, and the commentary to text no. 5.   Exs. 1–5, all complete cylinders, were discovered by Hormuzd Rassam, or his nephew Nimroud Rassam, during the 1878–82 excavations of the South-West Palace. J. Reade (ARRIM 4 [1986] pp. 33–34) suggests that they were discovered in the following order: ex. 3 (BM 22501), ex. 1 (BM 22503), ex. 4 (BM 22504), ex. 5 (Istanbul; formerly 80-7-19,3), and ex. 2 (BM 22500). Since BM 22501 (ex. 3) reached the British Museum in mid-1879, that complete cylinder is most likely the cylinder discovered in December 1878, in “the solid brick pillar ... between entrances g and h of Chamber IX.” BM 22503 (ex. 1) was found by N. Rassam on 25 October 1879, in the “first foundations” of Room VII, in the “small pillar at the entrance” (= the wall between Doors d and e). BM 22504 (ex. 4) was discovered by N. Rassam on 22 November 1879, in the “second foundations” of Room VII; the “second foundations” are thought to be the wall between Doors c and d. The Istanbul cylinder (formerly 80-7-19,3; ex. 5) was found by N. Rassam on 20 January 1880, in the “foundations” (that is, the wall) between Rooms VII and VIII. BM 22500 (ex. 2) is thought to have been discovered prior to December 1880 in a wall of Sennacherib’s palace; the details of its discovery are not known. See Reade, ARRIM 4 (1986) pp. 33–34 for further details, including the relevant documentation in the British Museum.   Several fragments of clay cylinders inscribed with copies of this text were discovered at Aššur. These are edited as exs. 9, 25, 43, 45, 48, 56, 60, 67, 69–70, 74, and 82–87. It is curious that texts whose building reports describe construction at Nineveh should be found at Aššur, and in more than one exemplar; note that some exemplars of text no. 1 and text no. 3 were also discovered at Aššur.   There are a number of cases where two or more fragments probably come from the same cylinder, but without any physical join (for example, exs. 29 and 34, and exs. 69 and 70 [suggested by O. Pedersén; Katalog p. 207]). Since such speculation is necessarily tentative, all unjoined fragments are registered in the catalogue as separate exemplars.   There are numerous scribal errors in the completely preserved cylinders, exs. 1–5; ex. 3 has an exceptionally high number of errors, dittographies in particular. The high number of erasures, omissions, and dittographies may be attributed to the fact that the scribes divided the ninety-four-line text in the exact same way on every copy of the inscription. Based on orthography, exs. 1–5 are assumed to have been inscribed by three different scribes; exs. 1–2 and 5 by one scribe, ex. 3 by another, and ex. 4 by a third scribe. The scribes of exs. 7, 29, and 68 marked every tenth line with a winkelhaken on the left edge; line counts also appear on text no. 3 ex. 1.   In addition to the eighty-seven certain exemplars of this inscription, there are two cylinder fragments that may preserve copies of this text. These are edited as text no. 1 ex. 1* and text no. 3 ex. 13*. See the catalogues and commentaries of those texts for further details. S.A. Picchioni (Sumer 42 [1979–81] p. 50 fig. 7) published a photograph of a badly damaged clay cylinder in the Mosul Museum. That object could be a duplicate of this inscription, but the photograph is illegible. Since its contents cannot be confirmed, it is excluded from the catalogue. MMA 86.11.197 (ex. 40) is included here courtesy of G. Frame. A copy and an edition of the fragment will appear in Spar, CTMMA 4 (forthcoming).   The master text is generally ex. 1, with some minor improvements from the other exemplars; see the on-page notes for details. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. Ex. 5 (formerly 80-7-19,3) was sent to Istanbul, but was copied (up to line 65) by G. Smith; his unpublished copy is in the Department of the Middle East of the British Museum. A transliteration of this complete cylinder is included in the score since it was collated from legible photographs. 81-2-4,47 (ex. 7) is really just the left rim of a cylinder, with only traces of one sign on each line. Enough traces are preserved to recognize that these are the first signs of lines 1–95 of this text, but it would be pedantic to transliterate those signs, all of which would appear between half brackets in the score; in lieu of this, ellipses (...) appear for each line of ex. 7. Ex. 8 is known only from a mostly illegible photograph (lines 47–54 are legible) published by T. Madhloom (Sumer 24 [1968] pl. 16B). Since that complete cylinder was not available for study, that exemplar does not appear in the score.    Bibliography    1878 G.

The cylinder was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni, governor of the city Kurbail (699), the year after the three-campaign version (text no. 4) was composed, and thus the military narration presumably included an account of Sennacherib’s fourth campaign, which was directed against Bīt-Yakīn. It is no longer possible to determine which building project at Nineveh this inscription’s building report commemorated.    Access  Sennacherib 5  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003479/]    Source:    K 01645  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P393942/]    Commentary   E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 61) suggests that there are four cylinder fragments that were inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni (699): (1) K 1645 (this text); (2) 82-5-22,24 (text no. 6); (3) Bu 91-5-9,32 (text no. 7); and (4) 81-2-4,46 (text no. 8). K 1645 and 81-2-4,46 (text no. 8) preserve part of the date line, but 82-5-22,24 (text no. 6) and Bu 91-5-9,32 (text no. 7) do not. The assignment of text no. 6 to 699 is based on the fact that the scribe responsible for copying that inscription on the cylinder separated passages with horizontal rulings. Prior to 699 (Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year), ruling lines were not used to divide units of text, but only to separate the date line from the inscription; cf. text nos. 1–4.   With regard to the content of these four texts, Frahm proposes that these editions contained a short prologue, accounts of Sennacherib’s first four campaigns, (probably) a concluding statement about forming a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers, a building report (with concluding formulae), and a date line.   Due to the poor state of preservation of text nos. 5–8, it is not certain how many inscriptions those four fragments represent. There could be as few as two texts or as many as four. Text nos. 5 and 8 clearly represent different editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae , as do text nos. 7 and 8. Text nos. 5, 6, and 7, on the other hand, either represent a single inscription or two or three different inscriptions. Moreover, text nos. 6 and 8 could be parts of the same text. Because text nos. 5–8 are not sufficiently preserved to be certain of their contents, each fragment is edited on its own.   The extant text of this inscription duplicates text no. 4 lines 1–3 and 93–94 and text no. 8 lines 1–3 and 19'–20', but with variation in the prologue and concluding formulae. Text no. 8 follows earlier texts (text nos. 1–4), while text no. 5 deviates in several regards. In the prologue, the epithets  šar lā šanān  (“unrivalled king”) and  rēʾûm mutnennû pāliḫ ilāni rabûti  (“pious shepherd who reveres the great gods”) were replaced by  šar kibrāt erbetti  (“king of the four quarters”),  rēʾûm itpēšu  (“capable shepherd”), and  migir ilāni rabûti  (“favorite of the great gods”). In the concluding formulae, Ištar, the patron deity of Nineveh, is invoked alongside Aššur. Because these editorial changes also appear in texts written on clay prisms (starting in 698), it is likely that text no. 5 was written later in the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni than text no. 8. For a study of Sennacherib’s titulary, see Liverani in Fales, ARIN pp. 225–257.   Although this inscription has more in common with later texts than with earlier texts, restorations are based on other cylinder inscriptions, namely text no. 4.

Frahm (Sanherib p. 61), is either part of the same inscription as text nos. 5 and/or 7, the same inscription as text no. 8, or a unique inscription. Because of the fragmentary nature of the sources, one cannot be certain of the relationship of 82-5-22,24 (this text) to K 1645 (text no. 5), Bu 91-5-9,32 (text no. 7), and 81-2-4,46 (text no. 8), and therefore this fragment is edited on its own.   With regard to its contents, the complete text may have contained a short prologue, accounts of Sennacherib’s first four campaigns, (probably) a concluding statement about forming a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers, a building report (with concluding formulae), and a date line. As for the year 82-5-22,24 was inscribed, Frahm (Sanherib p. 61) proposes 699 (Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year) since this text includes a report of Sennacherib’s fourth campaign (700) and because the scribe who copied out the text used a horizontal ruling to separate the accounts of the third and fourth campaigns (between lines 14' and 15'). Moreover, the report of the campaign to the Levant has more in common with those of later prism inscriptions than with the account of the third campaign in text no. 4; cf. lines 1'–14' to text no. 22 ii 82–iii 49 and text no. 4 lines 44–58.   The surface of the cylinder is very badly worn and relatively little of the extant text can be read with certainty, and thus no edition is given. However, we provide here a few minor notes, most of which follow Frahm, Sanherib p. 62. Line 6' reads: [... KUR. ia-ú-da-a ]-⸢ a ša ⸣  la ik-nu-šu a-na  [ ni ]-⸢ ri ⸣- ia x x  [...] “[... of the land Juda]h, who did submit to my [yok]e, ... [...].” The phrase  ša lā iknušu ana nīrīya  is included in the reports of later prism inscriptions, but not in that of text no. 4; compare text no. 22 iii 18–19 to text no. 4 line 49. Lines 12'–14' read: [...  pul-ḫi me-lam-me be ]-⸢ lu ⸣- ti-ia is-ḫu-pu-šú ? - ma  [LÚ]. úr-bi ù  ⸢LÚ⸣.[ERIM.MEŠ- šú  SIG₅.MEŠ ...] / [...  ni-s ] iq-ti gu-uḫ-li ták -⸢ kàs ⸣-[ si  NA₄.AN.ZA.GUL.ME GAL.MEŠ ...] / [...] MUNUS.NAR.MEŠ  a-na qé -⸢ reb  NINA ? ⸣.[KI ...] “[... fear of] my [lord]ly [splendor] overwhelmed him and [the] auxiliary forces and [his elite troops ... choi]ce antimony, [large] block[s of ..., ...] (and) female singers into  Nineveh  [...].” Those lines duplicate text no. 22 iii 38–47. After the initial report of the third campaign in text no. 4 (700), the list of payment received from Hezekiah was significantly reduced in subsequent editions (beginning in 699); compare text no. 22 iii 38–49 to text no. 4 lines 55–58.   After a ruling line, a small portion of one line (with traces of four signs) is preserved. Line 15' is probably the first line of an account of Sennacherib’s fourth campaign (700), rather than that of the building report. The extant text of that line, [...]  x x  GAL ?   x  [...], does not appear to correspond with text found in later prism inscriptions. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 62 and 200) has suggested that the text written on K 2627 + K 2666 + K 2676 (+) DT 320 may have had the same narration of military campaigns as 82-5-22,24 since that inscription also deviates from the fourth campaign report that was included in texts inscribed on octagonal and hexagonal prisms (text nos. 15–18 and 22–23). 82-5-22,24 and K 2627+, however, are both too poorly preserved to confirm Frahm’s proposal. K 2627+ will be edited in Part 2, with the other inscriptions of Sennacherib written on clay tablets.

Borger identified this text as a Sennacherib inscription. As noted by E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 61), this text is either part of the same inscription as text nos. 5 and/or 6, or a unique inscription. This text, however, belongs to a different text than 81-2-4,46 (text no. 8). Because of the fragmentary nature of the sources, one cannot be certain of the relationship of Bu 91-5-9,32 (this text) to K 1645 (text no. 5) and 82-5-22,24 (text no. 6), and therefore this fragment is edited on its own.   With regard to its contents and date, Frahm (Sanherib p. 61) proposes that Bu 91-5-9,32 was inscribed in 699 and that the text, when complete, may have contained a short prologue, accounts of Sennacherib’s first four campaigns, (probably) a concluding statement about forming a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers, a building report (with concluding formulae), and a date line. The preserved text most closely parallels an inscription written on tablet fragment K 2662 (rev. 3'–20'); see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 197–198. It is from that inscription, which is a later copy (reign of Ashurbanipal or Esarhaddon), that we are able to determine that the building report of Bu 91-5-9,32 commemorated the construction of Nineveh’s citadel wall. That project is confirmed by Ashurbanipal, who not only names Sennacherib as a previous builder but also records that he discovered foundation inscriptions of his when he renovated sections of that wall; see Borger, BIWA pp. 118–120 Prism D viii 64–100 and p. 183 Prism E Stück 18 lines 4–8.   Restorations are based on text no. 4, text no. 8, and K 2662 (Frahm, Sanherib pp. 197–198); lines 3' and 6'–8' are restored from K 2662. With regard to the restorations, preference is given, when possible, to text no. 4 and text no. 8 because K 2662 is a copy from the time of Ashurbanipal (or Esarhaddon).

The extant text contains parts of the prologue, an account of the first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II and his Chaldean and Elamite allies), and the building report (with concluding formulae). The complete inscription probably also included accounts of the second, third, and fourth campaigns, as well as a concluding statement about forming a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers. The building report commemorates the construction of the inner and outer walls of Nineveh, Badnigalbilukurašušu (“Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies”) and Badnigerimḫuluḫa (“Wall, Terrorizer of Enemies”), and various other public works, including the construction of aqueducts and a bridge.

Frahm (Sanherib p. 61), is either part of the same inscription as text no. 6 or a unique inscription; this text, however, belongs to a different text than K 1645 (text no. 5) and Bu 91-5-9,32 (text no. 7). Because of the fragmentary nature of the sources, one cannot be certain of the relationship of 81-2-4,46 (this text) to 82-5-22,24 (text no. 6) and therefore this fragment is edited on its own.   The extant text of the prologue and report of the first campaign (lines 1–15) and the concluding formulae (lines 19'–20') duplicates text no. 4 lines 1–15 and 93–94. Text no. 5, which was also written in the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni (699), includes several editorial changes known from inscriptions written on octagonal and hexagonal clay prisms (beginning in 698); for example, Sennacherib’s epithets  šar lā šanān  (“unrivalled king”) and  rēʾûm mutnennû pāliḫ ilāni rabûti  (“pious shepherd who reveres the great gods”) were replaced in text no. 5 (and texts written after 699) by  šar kibrāt erbetti  (“king of the four quarters”),  rēʾûm itpēšu  (“capable shepherd”), and  migir ilāni rabûti  (“favorite of the great gods”). Such differences between this text and text no. 5 indicate that 81-2-4,46 was inscribed earlier in the year than K 1645 (text no. 5) since it follows more closely the prologue and concluding formulae of text no. 4. Moreover, these changes indicate that several editorial changes were introduced to those passages during the year 699.   The building report (lines 1'–18') includes passages composed for earlier inscriptions (commemorating the construction of Egalzagdinutukua) and sections composed anew for inscriptions recording the construction of Badnigalbilukurašušu and Badnigerimḫuluḫa, Nineveh’s inner and outer walls. With regard to material borrowed from other cylinders (text nos. 1–4), lines 1'–3', 14', and 16'–18' duplicate (with a few minor changes) text no. 4 lines 86–92. As for lines 4'–13' and 15' — which describe the creation of a marsh, the construction of the walls of Nineveh, and the building of aqueducts — these passages were either composed anew for this inscription or were borrowed from an earlier text (now lost) that also commemorated those events. Those sections of the building report were incorporated (with editorial changes) into the building reports of inscriptions written on octagonal clay prisms inscribed from 698 to 695.

Physically the cylinder is similar to those with text nos. 12 and 13, but it does not join or come from the same cylinders with text nos. 12 and 13. Only a small portion of the middle of ex. 2 is preserved. Horizontal rulings separate each line of text on both exemplars.   Text nos. 10–13 are foundation inscriptions with no military narration (Grayson, Orientalia NS 49 [1980] p. 153). In the Sennacherib corpus, the text written on VA 8254, a stone horizontal prism from Aššur recording work on the Aššur Temple, best exemplifies this type of text because that inscription is complete; see Schroeder, KAH 2 no. 124 and Luckenbill, Senn. pp. 144–147 I7. The prologues, the petitions to the foundation inscription, and advice to future rulers of text nos. 10–13 duplicate those same passages (with minor variation) on VA 8254 (lines 1–8a and 30b–39). E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 109–111) regarded these cylinder fragments as inscriptions from Nineveh with “Aššur titulary,” but that designation is not entirely accurate. These texts, as well as the text written on VA 8254, should be regarded as foundation inscriptions with demilitarized, cult-focused prologues and building reports commemorating work on temples. Sennacherib’s titles and epithets in the prologues of text nos. 10–13 and of VA 8254 are probably representative of those used in foundation inscriptions without military conquests that were written on clay cylinders and stone horizontal prisms deposited in the structure of temples at Aššur and Nineveh. Therefore, there is no need to stress the Aššur aspect of the titulary. For a study of Sennacherib’s titulary, see Liverani in Fales, ARIN pp. 225–257.   Due to the poor state of preservation of text nos. 10–13, it is not certain how many inscriptions these fragments represent; there could be as few as two texts or as many as four. Text nos. 10 and 11 clearly represent different inscriptions, but text nos. 12 and 13 could be duplicates of either text nos. 10 or 11 or be parts of unique text(s). K 1635 (ex. 1) and A 16931 (ex. 2) are arbitrarily edited together, as they both refer to Ḫaya, the “god of scribes,” but BM 123418 (text no. 11), BM 127888 (text no. 12), and BM 128242 (text no. 13) are each edited on their own.   The master text is ex. 1, with some restorations from ex. 2. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. Restorations are based on VA 8254 lines 1–8a and 30b–39; that inscription will be edited in Part 2 with the other texts from Aššur.   The building report is poorly preserved and it describes work on a shrine of the god Ḫaya (formerly read as Ḫani), which may have been the Ezida temple (“True House”) at Nineveh since this deity, who is described in this text as the “god of scribes” (line 19), is often identified with Nabû, the pre-eminent scribal god of the first millennium; see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 110–111 and Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) p. 410. It has also been suggested that the shrine of Ḫaya was located in Aššur because the prologue, the passage requesting that the foundation inscription speak favorably about Sennacherib, and the advice to future rulers duplicate passages on texts from Aššur; see Menzel, Tempel 1 p. 79 and Frahm, Sanherib p. 110.

BM 127888 (text no. 12) and BM 128242 (text no. 13), however, could be duplicates of this text or copies of another inscription. Because all three pieces are not sufficiently preserved to be certain of their contents, the fragments are each edited on their own.   Although only small portions of the first eleven lines of the text are preserved, this inscription may have been similar in format to text no. 10 and the text written on VA 8254, a stone horizontal prism from Aššur recording work on the Aššur Temple; for the latter inscription, see Schroeder, KAH 2 no. 124 and Luckenbill, Senn. pp. 144–147 I7. Therefore, the complete text probably comprised a prologue, a building report, a passage requesting that the foundation inscription speak favorably about Sennacherib, and advice to future rulers. Based on Sennacherib’s titulary, the building report may have recorded work on a temple at Nineveh; see the commentary to text no. 10. At Nineveh, Sennacherib is known to have worked on the shrine of the god Ḫaya (text no. 10), the Sîn-Šamaš temple (text no. 36), the temple of the Lady of Nineveh (text no. 36), and the  akītu -house Ešaḫulezenzagmukam (text no. 37); another temple is mentioned in text no. 36 (line 3'), but the name of the deity to which it belonged is completely missing.

The prologue duplicates those of text nos. 10, 11, and 12, and that of the Aššur Temple Inscription (VA 8254), a stone horizontal prism from Aššur. The year during which the cylinder was inscribed is not known since no date line was included on the object.

Each line of text is separated by a horizontal ruling.   This text could be a duplicate of text nos. 10, 11, or 12, or it could be a unique text. Because BM 128242 does not preserve enough text to be certain of its contents, the inscription written on this fragment is edited on its own.   Although only small portions of the text are preserved, this inscription may have been similar in format to text no. 10 and the text written on VA 8254, a stone horizontal prism from Aššur recording work on the Aššur Temple; for the latter inscription, see Schroeder, KAH 2 no. 124 and Luckenbill, Senn. pp. 144–147 I7. See the commentary of text no. 10 for further details. The building report is completely missing, but it may have recorded work on a temple at Nineveh, perhaps the shrine of the god Ḫaya (text no. 10), the Sîn-Šamaš temple (text no. 36), the temple of the Lady of Nineveh (text no. 36), or the  akītu -house Ešaḫulezenzagmukam (text no. 37).

J. Reade and A. Millard both report seeing a Sennacherib prism dated to the eponymy of Šulmu-šarri, governor of the city Ḫalzi-atbar (698); neither, however, provides additional information about the object or the text. Because the inscription seen by Reade and Millard is still unpublished (except for its date) and since the object (or a photograph of it) cannot be located, its contents are not known with certainty. Its content, we assume, was probably similiar (or identical) to that of text no. 15 (see the commentary for further details).    Access  Sennacherib 14  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003488/]    Source:    JCS 27 p. 191  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P450335/]    Commentary   In 1975, J. Reade (JCS 27 p. 191), citing C. Walker as his source, reported that a prism dated to 698 was “in private hands.” In 1992, A. Millard (SAAS 2 p. 122) noted that the object was in the Klassiska Institutionen of Göteborgs Universitet. Its present location is not known, but this Sennacherib prism may be in a private collection in Sweden. For additional information, see Frahm, Sanherib p. 65.   According to Millard (SAAS 2 p. 122), the prism was inscribed on the fourteenth day of the month Araḫsamna (VIII), in the eponymy of Šulmu-šarri, governor of the city Ḫalzi-atbar ( m šùl-mu -LUGAL / LÚ.GAR.KUR URU. ḫal-zi -NA₄. at-bar ).   E. Frahm proposes that this unpublished prism was octagonal since Sennacherib’s scribes did not begin writing inscriptions on hexagonal prisms until 695. However, this may not be the case. At present, all of the known octagonal prisms (text nos. 15–18) were intended for Nineveh’s inner and outer walls (Badnigalbilukurašušu and Badnigerimḫuluḫa), while all of the known hexagonal prisms whose building reports are preserved (text nos. 22–23 and 25) were written for the armory. The available source material does not exclude the possibility that Sennacherib’s scribes wrote out texts on six-sided prisms as early as 698; such objects may have replaced cylinders as the principal medium of texts deposited in the structure of the “Palace Without a Rival” (and possibly the citadel wall) after 699. Therefore, it is not impossible that this unpublished prism was hexagonal.   With regard to the text itself, we can only speculate on its contents, just as Frahm has already done (Sanherib pp. 65–66). Given the fact that foundation inscriptions written in 699 and 697 contained a prologue, reports of the first four campaigns, a short passage stating that the king formed a large military contingent of archers and shield bearers, a building report, and concluding formulae, this text must have also had those same sections. As for the military narration, the accounts of Sennacherib’s third and fourth campaigns either duplicate those of text no. 15 or deviate from those reports in a few places, just like text nos. 16 and 19–21; note that text nos. 19–21, all of which are written on hexagonal prisms, duplicate a text that is inscribed on a fragmentarily preserved bull colossus (Smith Bull 4; 3 R pls. 12–13).   With regard to the building report, its contents depend on whether the prism was six- or eight-sided. Frahm, assuming this prism is octagonal, proposes that the building report could duplicate that of text no. 15 or follow the style of those of text nos. 7 or 8. Cf. text no. 7 lines 1'–8', text no. 8 lines 1'–20' (with the on-page note to line 1'), and text no. 15 v 18–viii 18''; also compare text no. 16 v 41–viii 63, since it is better preserved than text no. 15. Should Frahm’s conjectures prove correct, then this inscription would have been written for Nineveh’s inner and outer walls (Badnigalbilukurašušu and Badnigerimḫuluḫa) or for the citadel wall. However, if the prism was hexagonal, one would expect the building report to have been much shorter than that of text no. 15; this would probably have been the case if the inscription was intended for prisms deposited in the structure of the “Palace Without a Rival” (for which no foundation record written after 700 is known with certainty). Thus, this section may have included: (1) an introduction to Sennacherib’s building program at Nineveh; (2) a detailed account of the rebuilding of Egalzagdinutukua, the planting of a botanical garden, and the digging of canals for irrigating fields and orchards; (3) a general statement about enlarging Nineveh and restructuring its streets, alleys, and squares; and possibly (4) a passage recording the construction of a bridge. Reports of the construction of the inner wall (Badnigalbilukurašušu) and its fourteen gates, the building of the outer wall (Badnigerimḫuluḫa), the construction of aqueducts, and the creation of a marsh were probably omitted. In essence, the proposed building report follows the compositional arrangement of text no. 4, but with the expanded descriptions of text no. 15. Compare text no. 4 lines 61–92 to text no. 15 v 18–vii 13, 29'b–viii 1', and 8'b–18'; cf. also text no. 16 v 41–vii 21, 76b–80, 85–viii 3a, and 12–23. In sum, this inscription could either be a duplicate of text no. 15, a text very similar to that 697 edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  (an intermediary edition between text nos. 8 and 15), or a unique text. Frahm tentatively proposes that this unpublished prism could be a copy of text no. 15 that was inscribed in the eponymy of Šulmu-šarri (698), one year earlier than the known dated exemplars, which were inscribed in the eponymy of Nabû-dūrī-uṣur, governor of the city Tamnunna (697).

Sennacherib boasts also of forming a military contingent of 20,000 archers and 15,000 shield bearers from prisoners deported from conquered lands. The building report, which utilizes material from earlier inscriptions, includes: (1) an introduction to Sennacherib’s building program at Nineveh; (2) a detailed account of the rebuilding of Egalzagdinutukua and the planting of a botanical garden; (3) a passage describing the construction of the great wall Badnigalbilukurašušu, with its fourteen gates, and the outer stone wall Badnigerimḫuluḫa; (4) a general statement about enlarging Nineveh, restructuring its public areas, and building its walls; (5) a brief report recording the building of aqueducts and a bridge; (6) reports of the creation of a game preserve and a marsh; and (7) an account of the digging of canals for irrigating fields and orchards given to the citizens of Nineveh. In connection with the construction of his palace, Sennacherib openly criticizes work sponsored by his predecessors. He states that they had depleted valuable resources, performed certain tasks (namely the transport of stone bull colossi) at the wrong time of year, and exhausted the workforce. Moreover, he notes that the work had been clumsily done and the result was not in good taste. The text concludes with a short passage stating that Sennacherib celebrated the completion of his palace; Aššur and other deities are said to have been invited inside, where they were presented with offerings and given gifts. Four exemplars preserve a date and these were all inscribed in the first half of the eponymy of Nabû-dūrī-uṣur, governor of the city Tamnunna (697).

The two major features distinguishing this inscription from the following text are: (1) the military narration ends with a report of Sennacherib’s fourth campaign; and (2) a passage recording the depositing of inscriptions in the foundation of the citadel terrace and the raising of that terrace by 190 courses of brick is included in this text. There are a few other variants in the building report and these are noted in the on-page notes.   The building report contains material composed anew for this inscription or for text no. 14 (if that prism is inscribed with a unique text), and passages borrowed (with changes) from the building reports of earlier inscriptions, namely text no. 1, text no. 4, and text no. 8. Additional information is provided in the on-page notes.   In some instances, the identification of certain fragments as exemplars of this text, rather than of some other inscription, is difficult and is based on very limited criteria. Ex. 3, although its preserved text does not deviate from text no. 16, is included here since it is dated to 697, and not 696 or 695, when certain exemplars of text no. 16 were inscribed. Ex. 5 is included here arbitrarily since R. Borger has suggested that it could belong to the same prism as ex. 1. Since a non-physical join between Rm 28 (ex. 5) and K 1674+ (ex. 1) is not entirely certain, Rm 28 is edited here as its own exemplar; note that the extant contents of that prism fragment duplicate both this text and text no. 16. The attribution of exs. 6 and 7 to this text is based solely on the fact that the preserved text on those pieces follows ex. 4 by omitting text no. 16 viii 50–51:  iṣ-ṣu na-áš ši-pa-a-ti ib-qu-mu im-ḫa-ṣu ṣu-ba-ti-iš  “they picked cotton (lit. “trees bearing wool”) (and) wove it into clothing.” The attribution of exs. 8 and 9 to this inscription is very uncertain as the text preserved on these fragments does not contain anything specific to this text or text no. 16. The suggestion that ex. 9 is a duplicate of ex. 1 goes back to J. Reade (JCS 27 [1975] p. 191), presumably based on the column divisions; col. ii' (= col. iv) begins with iii 27', which may indicate that the prism from which this fragment came contained accounts of only four campaigns. Both exemplars are arbitrarily included here. The attribution of exs. 10, 11, and 12 is based on the fact that there is insufficient room for the report of the fifth campaign. The attribution of ex. 13 is based on the fact that its contents follow ex. 1 by not omitting Frahm, Sanherib p. 75 Baub. lines 85–94 (= vi 32–41), a passage stating that Sennacherib deposited foundation inscriptions in the citadel terrace and raised that terrace by 190 courses of brick; cf. text no. 16 vi 52–53. The attribution of exs. 14 and 16 is based solely on the fact that they follow ex. 1 and omit text no. 16 vii 20:  a-di iṣ-ṣu na-áš ši-pa-a-ti  “together with cotton (lit. “trees bearing wool”).”   Ex. 17 (VA 8421a–h) comprises eight fragments from the lower half of an eight-sided clay prism. Although parts of all eight columns and the bottom of the prism are preserved, most of the surface is very badly eroded. Because portions of the preserved text are completely illegible, only the legible lines are included in the catalogue.   There are twenty-nine other prism fragments that may be duplicates of this inscription, but they are not sufficiently preserved to determine whether they are actually exemplars of this text, rather than of some other inscription written on an octagonal prism. These fragments are edited with text no. 16 because that inscription is better preserved. The relevant pieces are exs. 1*–25*, 28*–29*, and 31*–32*. Moreover, K 4492 (Frahm, Sanherib p. 213 T 177), a fragmentarily preserved clay tablet from Nineveh (Kuyunjik), preserves part of the building report of this inscription. That fragment is not included here since it is from a tablet, not a prism, and is thus edited on its own in Part 2, with other texts inscribed on clay tablets.   BM 127970 and 79-7-8,305 almost certainly come from the same prism: they have a distinctive shape, the script is the same, and the contents do not overlap; and thus the fragments are edited as a single exemplar (ex. 4). K 1751 (ex. 11) and 80-7-19,101 (ex. 12) may belong to the same prism since K 1751 cols. i' and ii' end respectively with iv 35' and v 69 and 80-7-19,101 cols. i' and ii' begin respectively with iv 36' and vi 1. These two fragments, however, are not edited together as a single exemplar because it cannot be proven with certainty that K 1751 and 80-7-19,101 come from the same object. O. Pedersén (Katalog p. 155) suggests Ass 6643 (VA 8436; ex. 14) belongs to the same object as Ass 6673 (VA 8414) and Ass 6724 (Istanbul A 2039). This may be so, but it is best to edit them individually. Because it is unclear if Ass 6673 and Ass 6724 are fragments of a text recording work at Nineveh or at Aššur, those pieces are edited as text no. 16 exs. 29* and 32*. See the commentary of text no. 16 for further information.   The line numbering follows ex. 1 when possible, but the master line is a conflated text because of the fragmentary nature of ex. 1 (as well as of the other certain exemplars). The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: Ex. 1 in i 1–8, 1'–33', ii 1–10, 1''–22'', 28''–35'', iii 1–11, 16–19, 1'–33', iv 1–25, 1'–35', v 4–66, vi 12–68, vii 1–14, and viii 9''–28''; ex. 2 in i 34'–36', ii 23''–27'', 36''–37'', iv 36'– v 3, 67–vi 11, and 70–79; ex. 3 in vii 16'–29'; ex. 4 in vii 7'–15', 30'–31', and viii 1''–8''; ex. 5 in i 9–22 and viii 17'–19'; ex. 10 in iii 12–15; ex. 13 in vii 18–31; ex. 15 in vii 1'–5'; ex. 16 in vii 15–17 and viii 1'–15'; and ex. 17 in ii 1'–11'. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM. Restorations are based on text no. 16, text no. 17, and text no. 22; preference is given to text no. 16.    Bibliography    1853 G.

Apart from the account of the fifth campaign (to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, king of the city Ukku) and some variation in the building report, this inscription is a near duplicate of text no. 15. With regard to the fifth campaign, Sennacherib had his scribes describe in his  res gestae  the extremely rugged mountain terrain that he and his army had to traverse; he records that in the most difficult places he had to clamber forward on his own two feet, sit down when his legs got tired, and drink cold water to quench his thirst. The Judi Dagh Inscription (to be edited in RINAP 3/2) is proof that Sennacherib campaigned in the region and, furthermore, that he had an inscription carved on rock faces to commemorate his hard-earned victory over the insubmissive inhabitants of the Mount Nipur region (Judi Dagh, in southern Turkey); this inscribing of the rock face at Judi Dagh, however, is not recorded in accounts of the king’s fifth campaign. Upon his return to Nineveh, Sennacherib had his sculptors carve on his palace walls a relief depicting the narrow mountain passes through which his army marched and the difficult, steep terrain around the city Ukku. Two exemplars of this inscription preserve a date: one was inscribed in the eponymy of Šulmu-Bēl, governor of the city Talmusu (696), and the other in that of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur, governor of the city Šaḫuppa (695).

The two major features distinguishing this inscription from the previous text are: (1) the military narration ends with a report of Sennacherib’s fifth campaign; and (2) the passage recording the depositing of inscriptions in the foundation of the citadel terrace and the raising of that terrace by 190 courses of brick is omitted. There are a few other variants in the building report and these are noted in the on-page notes.   The evidence for considering exs. 3 and 10 as certain exemplars of this inscription is very limited. Although ex. 3 does not preserve text beyond the fifth campaign, it is fairly certain that K 1666 is an exemplar of this text, and not of text no. 17, as the line and column arrangement follow ex. 2 very closely; for this opinion, see also Reade, JCS 27 (1975) p. 192 and Frahm, Sanherib p. 69 (ex. c). The attribution of ex. 10 is based solely on the fact that it follows exs. 1 and 2 by having  i-na  1 ME 90  ti-ip-ki ul-la-a re-ši-šu  (“I raised its superstructure 190 courses of brick”) in vi 38; cf. text no. 15 vi 19, which has  am-šu-uḫ me-ši-iḫ-ta  “I measured (its) dimensions.” This is not, however, substantial proof that BM 127929 (ex. 10) preserves a copy of this inscription, rather than that of the previous text, especially since ex. 8 follows text no. 15 in this same passage. Following E. Frahm, ex. 10 is arbitrarily included here as if it were a certain exemplar.   Numerous other prism fragments could be duplicates of this text, but due to their poor state of preservation their attribution cannot be determined with certainty. Fragments that could be duplicates of text no. 15 or this text are edited as exs. 1*–23*, 28*–29*, and 31*–32*. Pieces that could be exemplars of text no. 15, this inscription, or text no. 17 are edited as exs. 24*–25*. Fragments that could be inscribed with copies of this inscription or text no. 17 are edited as exs. 26*–27*. In the case of exs. 1*–25*, they are edited here, rather than with text no. 15, since this inscription is generally the better preserved of the two texts. Moreover, exs. 28*–32* are all fragments of octagonal clay prisms from Aššur. Because the building report is not preserved on these pieces, it is not possible to determine with certainty if VA 8437, VA 8414, VA 8442, VA Ass 4720, and A 2039 (Istanbul) are exemplars of one of the known Nineveh inscriptions or an edition whose building report describes building activities at Aššur (VA 5061 + VA 5632a + VA 5632b + VA 7512 + ?  A 61 [unpublished] or VA 5634 [Frahm, KAL 3 no. 40]). Since the Aššur editions are badly damaged, these five fragments are tentatively edited here. Exs. 28*–29* and 31*–32* could be duplicates of text no. 15, this inscription, VA 5061+, or VA 5634. Ex. 30* could be a duplicate of this text, VA 5061+, or VA 5634. O. Pedersén (Katalog p. 155) suggests Ass 6643 (VA 8436; text no. 15 ex. 14) belongs to the same object as Ass 6673 (VA 8414; ex. 29*) and Ass 6724 (Istanbul A 2039; ex. 32*). This may be so, but it is best to edit them individually as the joins are not certain. VA 5061+ and VA 5634 will be edited in Part 2, with the inscriptions from Aššur. Ex. 32* is not included in the score as the piece was not examined; although a small portion of one column is visible in Ass ph 875, we are unable to positively identify the contents of ex. 32* col. i'.   Should exs. 1*–23*, 28*–29*, and 31* be exemplars of text no. 15, then those fragments would preserve the following lines of that inscription: ex. 1* is inscribed with i 1–21, ii 2–[...], iii 2–19, and viii 10'–19'; ex. 2* has i 1–20, ii 2–4', and iii 12–17; ex. 3* preserves i 1–21 and ii [...]–7'; ex. 4* has i 1–9 and ii 5–10 written on it; ex. 5* is inscribed with i 2–[...] and viii 4'–[...]; ex. 6* has i 4–17 and i 32'–38'; ex. 7* preserves i 6–[...], vii 2–7, and viii 2'–[20']; ex. 8* has viii 15'–2'' written on it; ex. 9* is inscribed with i [...]–21' and ii 3''–18''; ex. 10* has i 17'–39' and vi 48–59; ex. 11* preserves i 21'–ii 6 and ii 18''–37''; ex. 12* has ii 7–[...], iii 12–[...], and iv 23–[...] written on it; ex. 13* is inscribed with ii 8–[...], iii 10–[20], and iv 6–[26]; ex. 14* has ii 4'–[...] and iii 16–[...]; ex. 15* preserves ii [...]–10'' and iii 8'–16'; ex. 16* has ii 5''–11'' and iii 10'–19' written on it; ex. 17* is inscribed with iv 24–3'; ex. 18* has iv [...]–4'; ex. 19* preserves vi 3–11 and 72–vii 4; ex. 20* has vi 73–78 written on it; ex. 21* is inscribed with vi 75–vii 8 and viii 1'–15'; ex. 22* has vii 26–2'; ex. 23* preserves viii 1'–7'; ex. 28* has i 12'–17' written on it; ex. 29* is inscribed with i 24'–ii 10 and ii 26''–iii 10; and ex. 31* has iv 8'–27'.   With regard to ex. 6*, Frahm (Sanherib p. 70) tentatively suggests that this fragment is more likely a duplicate of text no. 15 based on the line divisions. Ex. 10* is known from F.M.Th. Böhl’s transliteration in the “Böhl Archive” in Leiden, which he presumably copied in 1932 in the Iraq Museum and which he reports was purchased from a dealer in Mosul. Böhl’s transliteration was unavailable for study and thus its entry in the score appears as ellipses (...) in the relevant passages. According to Frahm (Sanherib p. 71 ex. VV) col. “i” corresponds to text no. 22 i 40–52 (= i 55–72 of this text) and col. “vi” duplicates his Baub. lines 100–112 (= vi 60–71/72 of this text). J. Reade suggests that BM 134452 (ex. 7*) and BM 134461 (ex. 18*) could belong to the same prism; this is based on the script and the color of the clay. Frahm (Sanherib p. 70) suggests that BM 128271 (ex. 9*) and BM 127950 (ex. 17*) could belong to the same prism since they both have a similar black layer and other similar physical characteristics. This may be so, but it is best to edit them individually here.   Should exs. 24*–25* be exemplars of text no. 15 or text no. 17, then those fragments would preserve the following lines of those inscriptions: ex. 24* preserves text no. 15 i 11'–18'and viii 11''–16'' or text no. 17 i 40–47 and viii 69–74; and ex. 25* has text no. 15 ii 2–[...] and iii 7–16 or text no. 17 i 71–79 and ii 62–71 written on it.   Should exs. 26*–27* be exemplars of text no. 17, then those two fragments would preserve the following lines of that inscription: ex. 26* preserves text no. 17 ii 60–74, iii 48–63, and iv 38–47; and ex. 27* is inscribed with text no. 17 vii 54–69. Frahm (Sanherib p. 89) suggests that A 16920 (ex. 26*) and ND 5416 (ex. 27*) are probably exemplars of this inscription, rather than copies of text no. 17.   With regard to provenance, most of the exemplars come from Nineveh, but a few were discovered at Aššur (exs. 23* and 28*–32*) and Kalḫu (ex. 27*). The fragments comprising ex. 2 were purchased from the Parisian antiquities dealer I. Géjou; Frahm (Sanherib pp. 40 and 42) proposes that those pieces may have originated from Nineveh Area SH. Ex. 3 was acquired by C.J. Rich and purchased by the British Museum from Mrs. Rich in 1825; for details on the R[ich] collection (also 1825-5-3), see Stolper, Studies Larsen pp. 516–517 and Reade in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 108. Ex. 6 was brought to Rome from Mosul by Maximilian Ryllo (1802–1848), a Jesuit Father, and presented to Pope Gregory XVI in 1838. For details on this gift from Ryllo’s “expeditio Babylonica,” see Peiser, OLZ 7 (1904) cols. 36–46 and Budge, By Nile and Tigris 2 pp. 26–27.   One might prefer to use BM 103214+ (ex. 2) as exemplar 1 and the master text because it is the earliest in date, but BM 127837+ (ex. 1) is used instead since it is better preserved. The line numbering follows ex. 1 when possible, but the master line is a conflated text because of the fragmentary nature of ex. 1 (as well as of the other certain exemplars).

The prologue, the reports of the first five campaigns, and numerous passages in the building report duplicate those same passages in earlier versions of Sennacherib’s annals, especially text no. 16. The accounts of the events of the king’s 9th and 10th regnal years included in this text are presently not known from other extant inscriptions, presumably because Sennacherib remained at home, in Nineveh. In the eponymy of Šulmu-Bēl (696), Sennacherib reports that Kirūa, the city ruler of Illubru, a man who had been a loyal Assyrian vassal, incited rebellion in Ḫilakku (Cilicia) and that the Assyrian army was sent to deal with the hostilities. The city Illubru was captured and plundered, and Kirūa and his supporters were defeated and brought back to Nineveh, where they were flayed alive. Afterwards, Illubru was reorganized as an Assyrian center. In the following year, in the eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695), Sennacherib records that he sent his army to the city Tīl-Garimme, where Gurdî, the king of the city Urdutu (a man who may have been responsible for Sargon II’s death on the battlefield in 705), had incited rebellion. Urdutu is reported to have been taken and looted, but nothing is said about Gurdî, perhaps because he managed to escape. As for the building report, it is the longest and most detailed account of construction in and around Nineveh preserved in the Sennacherib corpus. It borrows material from earlier inscriptions and contains material composed anew for this text and other inscriptions written in 694 (Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year). In connection with work on the “Palace Without a Rival,” the king notes that the god Aššur and the goddess Ištar revealed to him the existence of cedar at Mount Sirāra, alabaster at Mount Ammanāna (the northern Anti-Lebanon), breccia at Kapridargilâ (“Dargilâ Village”), and limestone at the city Balāṭāya. He also takes credit for making significant advances in metalworking. In contrast to his predecessors, who are said to have ineffectually manufactured metal statues of themselves, Sennacherib boasts that he was able to efficiently and successfully cast tall columns and lion colossi from metal. In connection with supplying the huge number of gardens and orchards around Nineveh with water, Sennacherib reports that he had to look for new sources, as the waters of the Ḫusur River (mod. Khosr) were no longer sufficient. The king had three canals dug from the cities Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, and Sulu, all of which are located in the vicinity of Mount Muṣri (mod. Jebel Bašiqā). Two exemplars preserve a date and these were inscribed in the first half of the eponymy of Ilu-issīya, governor of the city Damascus (694). The inscription is commonly referred to as the “King Prism” or “Heidel Prism.” Ex. 1 is named after L.W. King, who first published a copy and photographs of it in 1909, and ex. 2 is named after A. Heidel, who published an edition and photographs in 1953.

The following text (text no. 18), written a few years after this inscription (691), may have been one of the longest texts written during his reign (800+ lines), but it is very fragmentarily preserved. Text no. 17 includes a short prologue, accounts of Sennacherib’s first five campaigns, reports of campaigns undertaken in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695), a passage stating that the king formed a large military contingent with prisoners from conquered lands, and a lengthy and detailed account of construction in and around Nineveh. The prologue and most of the military narration (reports of the first five campaigns) duplicate those same passages in text no. 15 and text no. 16. The accounts of the events of the king’s 9th and 10th regnal years are known only from this inscription; these passages may have been composed anew for this edition. As for the building report, it also contains material composed anew for this inscription and passages borrowed (with changes) from the building reports of text no. 15 and text no. 16. Additional information is provided in the on-page notes.   Only the certain exemplars of this inscription are edited here. Ex. 1* (I2b 1502), however, is an exception. Although it duplicates (with some omission and variation) a passage of the building account presently known only from this inscription, the fragment is not sufficiently preserved to be certain it is an exemplar of this text. I2b 1502 is provisionally edited here, rather than on its own. The omissions and major variants are cited in the on-page notes. Since we were unable to study this fragment from the original, the transliteration of ex. 1* in the score is based on E. Frahm’s transliteration (Sanherib p. 88), which is based on an unpublished copy of V.K. Šilejko sent to him by S. Hodjash.   Of the identified Sennacherib prism fragments in museum collections around the world there are four other fragments that could belong to this inscription rather than to one of the other texts written on octagonal prisms. These are edited with text no. 16 as exs. 24*–27*. See the catalogue and commentary of that inscription for further details.   The provenance of ex. 1 is uncertain. E.A.W. Budge (By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 23) states that BM 103000 “was found in a chamber built in the wall (or perhaps it was sunk in the actual wall), close to one of the human-headed bulls of one of the gates of Nineveh, and the bull near which it was placed must have been removed before it could be extracted from the wall. ... It is probable that cylinder No. 103,000 was discovered by the natives when they were breaking this bull into pieces, and we must be thankful that they had the sense enough to realize that it would fetch more money complete than when broken into pieces.” J. Reade (JCS 27 [1975] p. 192), following Budge’s account, tentatively suggests that ex. 1 came from the Nergal Gate. Frahm, drawing attention to a statement made by R.C. Thompson (Iraq 7 [1940] p. 85), points out that BM 103000 could have been discovered in Area SH (or similar provenance). According to records in the British Museum, this prism was purchased from I. Géjou. Thus, it is not impossible that ex. 1 was discovered as Budge describes and then purchased by Géjou, who in turn sold it to the British Museum.   A precise provenance for ex. 2 (IM 56578) is given by N. al Asil  apud  Heidel, Sumer 9 (1953) p. 117: “the prism was found embedded between the sun-dried bricks of the western wall of Nineveh, about three meters below the top of the wall, at a point about thirty meters north of where the present Mosul-Erbil road crosses the western city wall. He adds that there is no indication of a city gate at this point.” Frahm (Sanherib pp. 87–88) suggests that Rm 26 (ex. 4) could have come from Area SH since Borger has proposed international joins between Rm 15, Rm 17, and Rm 18 and fragments in the Oriental Institute (Chicago). For the proposed provenance of the Chicago fragments purchased by E. Chiera, see for example Thompson, Iraq 7 (1940) p. 85.   While one might prefer to use IM 56578 (ex. 2) as exemplar 1 because it is the best preserved copy of the inscription, BM 103000 (ex. 1) has been used instead to conform with older editions, all of which follow the line numbering of that prism. The master text is based upon both exs. 1 and 2. A score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM.

This inscription contains material from texts written earlier in the king’s reign (especially from those written in 694–692) and material composed anew for this text and other inscriptions written in 691 (Sennacherib’s 14th regnal year). Like the better preserved and known text nos. 22 and 23, the military narration of this edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  includes accounts of eight campaigns: (1) against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and his Chaldean and Elamite allies in Babylonia; (2) against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi; (3) to the Levant, against an Egyptian-led coalition that had been organized by the nobles and citizens of the city Ekron, and against the Judean king Hezekiah; (4) against Bīt-Yakīn; (5) to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, king of the city Ukku; (6) against the Chaldeans living in Elam and against Nergal-ušēzib, the king of Babylon; (7) against Elam; and (8) the battle of Ḫalulê, where Assyrian forces fought Babylonian and Elamite forces led by Mušēzib-Marduk, the king of Babylon, and Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of Elam. Accounts of the events of the king’s 9th and 10th regnal years (696 and 695), those undertaken by his officials to Ḫilakku (Cilicia) and the city Tīl-Garimme, however, are not included among the king’s victories on the battlefield. In connection with his work at Nineveh, Sennacherib records that he built the citadel wall (or some other structure in the citadel) as high as a mountain, created a wide road through the center of the city for triumphal processions, widened the moat that he had dug around the city earlier in his reign, and dug numerous canals in order to bring abundant water to Nineveh. One exemplar preserves date lines and that prism was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691).

The text, which was intended for octagonal clay prisms deposited in Nineveh’s wall (just like text nos. 15–17), includes a short prologue, accounts of eight of Sennacherib’s campaigns, and a lengthy and detailed account of construction in and around Nineveh. The prologue, most of the military narration (reports of the first seven campaigns), and much of the building report duplicate those same passages in text no. 17 and  res gestae  inscribed on (six- and eight-sided) prisms in 693 (the king’s 12th regnal year) and 692 (his 13th regnal year); reports of the sixth campaign (against the Chaldeans living in Elam and against Nergal-ušēzib) were first recorded in texts written in the eponymy of Iddin-aḫḫē (693) and those of the seventh campaign (against Elam) were first described in  res gestae  written in the eponymy of Zazāya (692). Accounts of the eighth campaign (the battle of Ḫalulê), as well as sections of the building report, were composed anew for this text (and possibly other inscriptions written in 691). Because no intermediary editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  between text no. 17 and this text are known, it is difficult to trace the editorial history of the various passages of the building report — that is, how the building report of text no. 17 evolved into that of this foundation inscription. Some additional information is provided in the on-page notes.   Ex. 1 presently comprises eight fragments, several of which are composed of many smaller fragments. For details on the (physical and non-physical) joins and the suggestion that the fragments belong to a single exemplar, see Frahm, Sanherib p. 90; cf. also Reade, JCS 27 (1975) pp. 193–194. In general, we agree with E. Frahm’s assessment of the pieces. The various fragments of ex. 1 could very well belong to one and the same prism and thus we see no reason why all of the fragments of ex. 1 should not be edited together. Note, however, that BM 127914 may be part of another prism; the vertical ruling line between the columns does not appear to match that of the other fragments. As for the date of composition, collation reveals that the prism was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni (691). The date lines (viii 23'''–25''') now read: [...]  x  / [ li-mu   m EN-IGI- a ]-⸢ ni ⸣ / [LÚ.EN.NAM URU. gar-ga ]-⸢ miš ⸣ “[The month ..., (... day,) eponymy of Bēl-ēmurann]i, [governor of the city Carchem]ish.” The traces of the NI and MES signs match exactly those in the date written on text no. 22 ex. 2. Cf. Frahm, Sanherib p. 94 and pl. III.   Ex. 1*, a fragment of an octagonal clay prism, is inscribed with either a copy of this inscription or another text whose military narration contained at least eight of Sennacherib’s campaigns (up to the battle of Ḫalulê). Since the building report is not preserved, 83-1-18,605 is regarded here as a fragment of uncertain attribution.   E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 89) regarded 80-7-19,317 as a duplicate of this text, but it is more likely a duplicate of text no. 22 or text no. 23 since it appears to be from a hexagonal, not an octagonal, prism; that piece is edited as text no. 22 ex. 6*. A prism fragment published by V. Scheil (Prisme p. 45) could be a duplicate of this inscription, text no. 22, or text no. 23, but because we were unable to examine that piece, it is not known if it is part of a six- or eight-sided prism, and thus it is arbitrarily edited as text no. 22 ex. 9*.   Ex. 1 is the master text, but ex. 1* is the master text for col. iii 1''–9'' and col. iv 1''–11''. Since exs. 1 and 1* do not overlap, no score is provided on the CD-ROM. Restorations are based on text no. 17, text no. 22, and text no. 23; preference is generally given to text no. 22 (ex. 2) and text no. 23.   The tiny fragment K 19861 (Frahm, Sanherib p. 96) has traces of a line that duplicates vi 28' of this text (see the note to the line), but otherwise the scant traces do not seem to match this portion of the text.

The accounts of the third, fourth, and fifth campaigns, as far as they are preserved, duplicate those same reports of military narration in Smith Bull 4, an inscription written on a bull colossus stationed in Court H, Door  a  of Sennacherib’s palace (the South-West Palace). This edition of the king’s  res gestae  was probably written on prisms in 695, as suggested by the fact that the military narration ends with a report of the fifth campaign (to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, king of the city Ukku) and by the number of prisoners said to be conscripted into Sennacherib’s army (20,400 archers and 20,200 shield bearers).

With regard to the year during which the prism from which this piece originates was inscribed, E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 101–102) suggests 695 (rather than 696) not only because the military narration ends with an account of the fifth campaign (just like text no. 16), but because the number of prisoners conscripted into Sennacherib’s army is greater than that of text no. 16; this inscription states that 20,400 archers and 20,200 shield bearers were added to the king’s army, while text no. 16 records that Sennacherib formed a military contingent of only 20,000 archers (and) 15,000 shield bearers.   Following the style of text no. 22 and text no. 23, the building report of this inscription (which is completely missing) probably also described work on a single project at Nineveh; compare the building reports of texts inscribed on eight-sided prisms (text nos. 15–18), which record work on numerous projects in and around that same city. Therefore, the building report of 83-1-18,599 may have described the construction and decoration of the “Palace Without a Rival” (for which no foundation record written after 700 is known with certainty) or the armory (for which the earliest known accounts of its construction come from texts written in 691). Should it commemorate work on Egalzagdinutukua, as suggested by the fact that its military narration closely follows that of Smith Bull 4, then the description may have been similiar or identical to: (1) text no. 16 v 41–vii 21 and viii 3b–51; (2) text no. 17 v 23–vii 57 and viii 16–64; or (3) Smith Bull 4 lines 106b–161a.   The extant text duplicates Smith Bull 4 (3 R pls. 12–13) lines 30–33 and 43–47. Restorations are generally based on that inscription.

Because the extant text duplicates text known from Smith Bull 4 (3 R pls. 12–13) and since inscriptions duplicating reports of military narration on that same bull were written on six-sided prisms (text nos. 19 and 21), E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 102) has suggested that this small fragment may have been from a hexagonal prism. Following Frahm, Sm 2093 is tentatively regarded as part of a six-sided prism.   Given that only parts of sixteen lines are preserved, it is not possible to determine if the military narration of this edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  ended with the report of the sixth campaign (just like Smith Bull 4) or with an account of the seventh (or even the eighth) campaign. Moreover, it is not known what project its building report commemorated; see the commentary of text no. 19 for some possibilities (assuming that Sm 2093 is from a hexagonal prism).

The piece is inscribed with either text no. 19, text no. 20, or another inscription.

Since only a small portion of the original is preserved (the base and the lower parts of cols. ii and iii), it is no longer possible to determine if the prism is inscribed with a copy of text no. 19 (695; five campaigns and a building report), text no. 20 (probably 693; six or more campaigns and a building report), or another inscription. Therefore, it is edited on its own. Cf. J.

This inscription contains material from texts written earlier in the king’s reign (especially those written in 694–692) and material composed anew for this text and other inscriptions written in 691 (Sennacherib’s 14th regnal year). Like text no. 18 and text no. 23, the military narration of this edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  includes accounts of eight campaigns: (1) against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and his Chaldean and Elamite allies in Babylonia; (2) against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi; (3) to the Levant, against an Egyptian-led coalition that had been organized by the nobles and citizens of the city Ekron, and against the Judean king Hezekiah; (4) against Bīt-Yakīn; (5) to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku; (6) against the Chaldeans living in Elam and against Šūzubu (Nergal-ušēzib), the king of Babylon; (7) against Elam; and (8) the battle of Ḫalulê, where Assyrian forces battled Babylonian and Elamite forces led by Šūzubu (Mušēzib-Marduk), the king of Babylon, and Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu), the king of Elam. Accounts of the events of the king’s 9th and 10th regnal years (696 and 695), the campaigns undertaken by his officials to Ḫilakku (Cilicia) and the city Tīl-Garimme, however, are not included among the king’s victories on the battlefield. In the building report, Sennacherib says that after he had completed the “Palace Without a Rival” (the South-West Palace) he started work on an armory, which he refers to as the  ekal kutalli  (the “Rear Palace”). He tore down the former palace, which he complains was too small, poorly constructed, and dilapidated. On a high terrace built upon a new plot of land (the Nineveh mound now called Nebi Yunus), Sennacherib constructed a new palace consisting of two wings, one in the Syrian style and one in the Assyrian style, and a large outer courtyard. He decorated the building in a fitting fashion, which included large limestone bull colossi stationed in its gateways. The two complete exemplars preserve a date. One (ex. 2) was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691), and the other (ex. 1) was inscribed in the eponymy of Gaḫilu, governor of the city Ḫatarikka (689). The inscription is commonly referred to as the “Chicago Prism” or “Taylor Prism” (or “Taylor Cylinder” in earlier literature). Ex. 1 is named after the city in which it now resides (Chicago, in the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago); ex. 2 is named after Col. J. Taylor, who first acquired the object.

Although the month and day that text no. 18 ex. 1 and text no. 23 ex. 1 were inscribed are missing, both of those prisms were probably inscribed earlier in the year than ex. 1 of this text, which is dated to the 20th day of the month Addaru (XII). Because the building account of text no. 23 is shorter than that of this inscription, it is possible that that text was written before this one and that the building report of this edition is an expanded version of that passage. Of course, it is not impossible that text no. 23 is the later of the two inscriptions; cf. the commentary of that text and Frahm, Sanherib p. 106.   The text was intended for hexagonal clay prisms deposited in the armory (just like text no. 23) and it includes a short prologue, accounts of eight of Sennacherib’s campaigns, and a lengthy and detailed account of the building and decoration of the  ekal kutalli  (the “Rear Palace”). The prologue and most of the military narration (reports of the first seven campaigns) duplicate those same passages in text no. 17 and  res gestae  inscribed on (six- and eight-sided) prisms in 693 (the king’s 12th regnal year) and 692 (his 13th regnal year); reports of the sixth campaign (against the Chaldeans living in Elam and against Nergal-ušēzib) were first recorded in texts written in the eponymy of Iddin-aḫḫē (693) and those of the seventh campaign (against Elam) were first described in  res gestae  written in the eponymy of Zazāya (692). Accounts of the eighth campaign (the battle of Ḫalulê) were composed anew for this text and other inscriptions written in 691; for literary allusions to  Enūma eliš  in the account of the battle of Ḫalulê, see Weissert, HSAO 6 pp. 191–202. The building report may be an expanded version of that of text no. 23, or possibly an earlier, longer version of it. Additional information on the differences between the two editions is provided in the on-page notes.   Exs. 3–5 are regarded as certain exemplars of this inscription because they all come from hexagonal clay prisms and since they all preserve part of the same building report as exs. 1–2. However, exs. 1*–10* are regarded as of uncertain attribution since they do not preserve the building account and therefore could be duplicates of text no. 23. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 89) assigned 80-7-19,317 as a duplicate of text no. 18, but it is more likely a duplicate of this text or text no. 23 since it appears to be from a hexagonal, not an octagonal, prism; that piece is edited here as ex. 6*. A prism fragment published by V. Scheil (Prisme p. 45) could be a duplicate of text no. 18, this text, or text no. 23. Because we were unable to examine that piece, it is not known if it is part of a six- or eight-sided prism and thus it is arbitrarily edited here as ex. 9*. Moreover, its contents have not been included in the score; the variants noted by Scheil, however, are included in the minor variants. Should exs. 1*–10* be exemplars of text no. 23, then those fragments would preserve the following lines of that inscription: ex. 1* contains i 1–9 and 62–69; ex. 2* has i 1–4, v 9–19, and vi 8–16; ex. 3* preserves i 18–25 and ii 19–26; ex. 4* is inscribed with i 36–53 and ii 19–35; ex. 5* has i 75–ii 25 and ii 77–iii 27 written on it; ex. 6* contains iv 11–17 and v 11?–13?; ex. 7* has iv 24–35 and v 25–34; ex. 8* preserves v 3–11 and vi 13–16; ex. 9* is inscribed with v 9–24; and ex. 10* has v 27–37 and vi 22–26 written on it. Exs. 2* and 8* may be exemplars of this text rather than text no. 23 since they both include a reference to Nabû-šuma-iškun, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan), in the report of the eighth campaign, a detail omitted in text no. 23. However, one variant cannot be used to determine the attribution of these pieces with certainty.   J.H. Breasted recorded the purchase of the “Chicago Prism” (ex. 1) in a journal entry (April, 1920). He records: “I have come upon very important antiquities among the native dealers in Baghdad — especially a large six-sided baked clay prism, eighteen inches high, bearing the Royal Annals of Sennacherib. But many obstacles lie in the way of its purchase — the owner’s exorbitant price, an export permit from the government, etc.” (C. Breasted, Pioneer to the Past p. 275). R.C. Thompson (Iraq 7 [1940] p. 85) suggests that ex. 1 may have come from Area SH, rather than Nebi Yunus, since a considerable number of prisms and fragments were discovered just a few feet below the surface and thus many of the prisms and fragments sold on the market may have come from this area or a similar provenance. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 103) has already correctly pointed out that Thompson’s suggested provenance for ex. 1 is not based on concrete evidence.   With regard to the discovery of ex. 2, there is no firm evidence for when and where Col. J. Taylor acquired it; see Pallis, Antiquity of Iraq pp. 69–70. A.H. Layard (Nineveh 2 p. 186; and Discoveries p. 345) suggests the object was found at Nebi Yunus; he says nothing about when or how it came into the possession of Col. Taylor. L.W. King (CT 26 p. 8) states that Col. J.E. Taylor (error for Col. J. Taylor) discovered the hexagonal prism at Nebi Yunus in 1830 and that it was purchased by the British Museum some 25 years later; according to Budge, Sir H. Rawlinson purchased the six-sided clay object on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum from Mrs. Taylor in July 1855. E.A.W. Budge (By Nile and Tigris 2 pp. 25–26) proposes that the object may have been purchased when Col. J. Taylor visited Nebi Yunus in 1830; he refutes F. Talbot’s claim (JRAS 19 [1887] p. 135) that this prism was found at Kuyunjik. Budge also records that Rawlinson had a paper “rubbing” made of all six sides in 1840 and that R. Ready made a plaster facsimile for the British Museum from those “rubbings.”   K. Radner (personal communication) has recently identified a prism fragment in the Sulaimaniya Museum (SM 409) as a duplicate of this inscription and that piece is included here as ex. 4 courtesy of her. She will publish photographs and an edition of SM 409 in AfO 52 (forthcoming).   While one might prefer to use the “Taylor Prism” (ex. 2) as exemplar 1 and the master text because it is the earliest in date, the “Chicago Prism” (ex. 1) has been used instead since its line numbering, as given in Luckenbill’s edition, has become the standard. The variants that Luckenbill gives for ex. 2 are from the copy in 1 R pls. 37–42. Many of those “variants” are in fact mistakes in the copy and not on the original prism; for example, see the numeral in i 36 and the on-page note to vi 67.

This inscription contains the same prologue and military narration as the previous text, but its building report has a shorter description of the rebuilding of the armory, which Sennacherib refers to as the  ekal kutalli  (the “Rear Palace”). This report records the construction of only one wing of the building and its decoration, which included large limestone bull colossi stationed in its gateways; text no. 22 describes the building of two wings, one in the Syrian style and one in the Assyrian style, and a large outer courtyard. Both exemplars partially preserve dates. One prism (ex. 1) was written in an unknown month in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni, governor of the city Carchemish (691), and the other (ex. 2) was inscribed in Intercalary Addaru (XII₂) of an unknown year. The inscription is commonly referred to as the “Jerusalem Prism”; ex. 1 is named after the city in which it now resides (Jerusalem, the Israel Museum).

Because neither exemplar preserves a complete date, it is uncertain if this text was written prior to or after text no. 22. P. Ling-Israel (Studies Artzi p. 214 n. 11 and p. 220) suggests that ex. 1 of this text was written before text no. 22 ex. 2, which is dated to the 20th day of the month Addaru (XII), and proposes that that copy of text no. 23 was “not accepted as an official copy” and that text no. 22 ex. 2 was inscribed immediately after it. Ling-Israel elaborated further on the proposed relationship of the two inscriptions: “The major differences between the prisms are limited to the ‘Building Inscription’ ( ekal kutalli  section). Here, the scribe uses a less literary style than his fellow scribes who wrote the other two texts. The brevity of his version was not caused by lack of space. It was perhaps due to his different scribal education, and his different aims and conceptions. It is quite possible that the brevity and imperfection of his ‘Building Inscription’ was the major cause for the rejection of  his  eight-campaign version by the official royal scribal tradition. For two years later (in 689 B.C.E.), when a new copy of the text was commissioned, it was the version of another prism (namely, that of the Taylor Prism) which was selected as a model, and not his.” S.J. Lieberman (JAOS 112 [1992] p. 689) very tentatively reads the month the prism was inscribed in as ⸢ITI.BÁR.ZAG.GAR⸣, “the month Nisannu (I),” which, if correct, would clearly place the date of ex. 1 of this text much earlier than text no. 22 ex. 2; cf. also his remarks on the quote above. We cannot, however, confirm Lieberman’s reading from the published photographs of the object; see also Frahm, Sanherib p. 106. E. Frahm raises the possibility that ex. 1 (Israel Museum 71.72.249) may have been inscribed at the same time as ex. 2 (BM 134449a), which is dated to Intercalary Addaru (XII₂) of an unknown year, and therefore the prisms were inscribed one month later than text no. 22 ex. 2. Frahm rightly notes that there is no known evidence for Intercalary Addaru (XII₂) in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni (691). There is no reason, however, to assume that ex. 1 and ex. 2 were written at the same time. Comparison of the building reports of this inscription and text no. 22 suggests to us that this inscription may have been the earlier of the two prism inscriptions, namely since this inscription describes the construction of only one wing of the armory, rather than two wings and an outer courtyard. Thus, the report of the armory’s construction in text no. 22 may be a later, expanded version of the building report of ex. 1 of this text. Because we lack firm evidence, we cannot exclude the possibility that text no. 22 ex. 2 is earlier than ex. 1 of this text. Should this prove to be the case, then the building report of this text would be a later, abridged version of the building report of text no. 22.   The text, which was intended for hexagonal clay prisms deposited in the armory (just like text no. 22), includes a short prologue, accounts of eight of Sennacherib’s campaigns, and an account of the building and decoration of a wing of the  ekal kutalli  (the “Rear Palace”). Additional information on the differences between this inscription and text no. 22 is provided in the on-page notes.   BM 134449a (ex. 2) duplicates only a small portion of ex. 1. Although it follows very closely the building report and concluding formulae of this text, the piece is not sufficiently preserved to be absolutely certain that it preserves a copy of this text, rather than another inscription written ca. 691–689. Following Frahm (Sanherib p. 105), BM 134449a is edited here as if it were a certain exemplar.   In addition to these two exemplars, there are ten other prism fragments that may preserve copies of this text. These are edited as exs. 1*–10* of text no. 22. See the catalogue and commentary of that text for further details.   The provenance of ex. 1 is presumed to be Nineveh. It was purchased by the Israel Museum from Sotheby’s (8 December 1970; lot no. 148) at the recommendation of A. Shaffer; that purchase was made possible by the contributions of Mrs. M. Sacher (London) and Mrs. J. Ungeleider (New York). Ex. 2 was discovered at Nineveh by R.C. Thompson, but its find spot was not recorded.   Ex. 1 is the master text. Since ex. 2 preserves only a small portion of the text, a partial score (v 48–63 and vi 48–61) is provided on the CD-ROM. Restorations are based on text no. 22.

Only a small portion of the complete text is extant. The prologue, parts of reports of the first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II and his Chaldean and Elamite allies), second campaign (against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi), and the second conquest of Babylon, and the beginning of the building account (or a report of an expedition to Arabia) are preserved. With regard to the capture of Babylon in 689, Sennacherib records that he returned the gods of the city Ekallātum to their rightful place after 418 years and that he utterly destroyed Babylon and its temples by diverting water from canals; the actual destruction was probably not as bad as Sennacherib describes. Although neither exemplar preserves a date, the prisms were inscribed in 688 (eponymy of Iddin-aḫḫē; the king’s 17th regnal year) or later.

Reade (JCS 27 [1975] p. 194) and E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 106) tentatively assign K 1665 (ex. 1*) as a duplicate of K 1634 (ex. 1), the only certain exemplar of this inscription; Frahm notes that line lengths and line divisions of the two pieces are similar. Ex. 1* does not preserve enough text to be certain that it is inscribed with the same text as ex. 1. Following Reade and Frahm, K 1665 is tentatively edited with K 1634. Since the pieces overlap, it is certain that these fragments do not come from the same prism. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 106–107) has raised the possibility that BM 134559 could be a duplicate of K 1634 (ex. 1); this tentative attribution is based solely on the fact that there appears to be sufficient room for a report of the destruction of Babylon in 689 between col. i' 12', which describes the battle of Ḫalulê, and col. ii' 1', which records the construction of the armory at Nineveh. Whether or not BM 134559 is a duplicate depends on the contents of K 1634 col. i' 17'–18' (= vi 17'–18'). These two lines contain the first two lines of either the building account or a report of military narration. Frahm (Sanherib p. 107) forwards the possibility that these badly damaged lines could preserve the beginning of a report describing an expedition to Arabia or the opening lines of an account recording work on the Sebetti temple at Nineveh, a project otherwise not attested in the extant Sennacherib corpus; for details, see the on-page note to vi 17'–18' and Frahm, Sanherib p. 107. Too little is preserved to confirm or reject these conjectures. Because we cannot identify the contents of K 1634 col. i' 17'–18' with certainty and because we cannot prove that BM 134559 is inscribed with the same inscription as K 1634, it is best to edit that fragment on its own (text no. 25).   The text, we assume, included a short prologue, accounts of eight of Sennacherib’s campaigns and the conquest and destruction of Babylon in 689, and a report of building at Nineveh (the armory, the Sebetti temple, or another building); this inscription may also include a report describing an expedition to Arabia. In addition to the uncertainty about the contents of vi 17'–18' (building report or military narration), it is not known if the report of the battle of Ḫalulê (the eighth campaign) in this inscription duplicated that of the 691–689 editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  (text nos. 18 and 22–23) or that of the Bavian Inscription, as E. Weissert (HSAO 6 p. 202) has suggested. Compare text no. 22 v 17–vi 35 to the Bavian Inscription lines 34b–43a (Luckenbill, Senn. pp. 82–83).   The master text is ex. 1 in i 23–26 and vi 1'–18', and ex. 1* in i 1–11 and ii 1'–9'. Col. i 12–22 is a conflation of both exemplars, but the line division follows ex. 1. Because exs. 1 and 1* overlap in only a few lines, a partial score (i 12–22) is provided on the CD-ROM. Col. i 1–26 and ii 1'–9' duplicate text no. 22 i 1–25 and ii 29–36. Col. vi 1'–16' duplicate the Bavian Inscription lines 48–54a (Luckenbill, Senn. pp. 83–84). Restorations are based on those inscriptions.

Although only a small portion of the report of the eighth campaign (the battle of Ḫalulê) and the building report (the armory at Nineveh) are preserved, this edition of the king’s  res gestae , like text no. 24, probably contained an account of the second conquest of Babylon, during which that city and its temples are said to have been utterly destroyed. The building report, as far as it is preserved, contains the same description of work on the armory ( ekal kutalli , the “Rear Palace”) as text no. 22. Because only small portions of the complete text are preserved, it is not impossible that this fragment is inscribed with a copy of text no. 24, rather than with that of another inscription.

The text, as far as it is preserved, is similar to text no. 34, a text inscribed on a large stone tablet. The portion that remains, which comes from the bottom of cols. i and ii of the prism, contains abbreviated reports of his first five campaigns, the campaign that took place in the eponymy of Šulmu-Bēl (696; Sennacherib’s 9th regnal year), and his seventh campaign. Presumably, the missing portions of the military narration included accounts of the campaign that took place in the eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695; the king’s 10th regnal year), the eighth campaign, and possibly one or more of his post-691 campaigns (the conquest and destruction of Babylon in 689, to Arabia, etc.). As for the building report, it may have described the rebuilding and decoration of the armory, as suggested by the fact that this inscription closely parallels text no. 34. Although the date lines are completely broken away, this edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  is generally thought to have been written in 687 (eponymy of Sennacherib; the king’s 18th regnal year) or later.

Thus, any statements about its contents, date, and length are largely speculative. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 108), having compared the text preserved on BM 121025 with the one inscribed on a large stone tablet, the so-called “Nebi Yunus Inscription” (text no. 34), noted that: (1) the inscription probably included reports of the campaign that took place in the eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695; against the city Tīl-Garimme) and the eighth campaign (the battle of Ḫalulê); (2) the prism may have been much smaller than other known octagonal and hexagonal prisms of Sennacherib, with ca. 43 lines per column, for a total of ca. 258 lines of text (1:2.3 ratio); (3) the building report may have been the same or similar to that of the “Nebi Yunus Inscription” (text no. 34); and (4), assuming no. 3 above, there appears to be sufficient room (ca. 42 lines) for report(s) of Sennacherib’s post-691 campaigns. Given the lack of evidence, we can add little to Frahm’s conjectures.   The contents are similar to text no. 34 lines 10–17 and 34–39 and K 4507 i 1'–4' (Frahm, Sanherib pp. 202–203 T 173; to be edited in Part 2). Col. i 1', 4'–5', 7', 16'–17', ii 1'–3', 5'–7', and 10' deviate from text no. 34. When possible, restorations are based on text no. 34.

Actually, they are ‘triangular’ prisms with wide and fairly flat column dividers (ca. 1.3–2 cm). Thus, the three inscribed faces are referred to in this edition as cols. i, ii, and iii, and not as cols. i, iii, and v (with blank cols. ii, iv, and vi). Each column had ca. 22–27 short lines of text, often with only one word per line. Since the tops of exs. 1, 2, and 4 and the base of ex. 3 are preserved, it is certain that none of the four exemplars come from the same object. Moreover, exs. 1–3 were likely written by different scribes; the script of ex. 2 is neater and smaller than that of ex. 1 and the wedges of ex. 3 are more deeply impressed than those of exs. 1–2.   The text comprises only the prologue of text nos. 15–18 and 22–23. This oddity, as well as some orthographic abnormalities (ii 6, 8, and 10), may suggest that the objects were scribal exercises written on practice prisms. However, it cannot be ruled out that these three-sided prisms had some practical application, such as a foundation deposit or a site marker.   A precise date of composition cannot be determined with certainty. However, since the text (at least in ex. 4) includes a passage stating that the god Aššur made all of the black-headed people bow down at Sennacherib’s feet, these prisms could not have been inscribed before 698 or 697, when that section was added to the prologue of the king’s  res gestae . Unfortunately, the evidence needed to determine if these objects were prepared ca. 694–689 ( šulmu šamši  or  šalām šamši ) is missing; in 694, 693, 692, or 691,  ultu tiāmti elēnīti ša šulmu šamši  (“from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun”) was changed to  ultu tiāmti elēnīti ša šalām šamši .   NIN/89/10 (ex. 4) is included here courtesy of D. Stronach. A detailed study and edition of that fragment will appear in Pickworth, Nineveh 2, which is a catalogue of the small finds discovered during UC Berkeley's excavations at Nineveh.   The text, when complete, would have duplicated text no. 15 i 1–[26], text no. 16 i 1–26, text no. 17 i 1–21, text no. 22 i 1–19, and text no. 23 i 1–17. Because exs. 1–4 are all badly damaged, the master line is a conflation of all four exemplars. When possible, the line and column divisions follow ex. 1.

Should the piece come from a prism, then Sm 2029 may come from a hexagonal prism, as suggested by the width of the lines; Frahm (Sanherib p. 109) suggests that it may have come from a relatively late edition (691 or later).

Reade (JCS 27 [1975] p. 192) has suggested that 82-5-22,22 is a fragment of an octagonal prism and a duplicate of text no. 17. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 109), however, thought that it belonged to a ten-sided prism because the angle of the two preserved faces best fits a decagonal prism. 82-5-22,22 was re-examined and checked against BM 103000 (text no. 17 ex. 1) and we agree with Frahm: this piece was probably from a ten-sided prism, despite the fact that there are otherwise no known decagonal prisms from the reign of Sennacherib (except text no. 32, which could possibly come from the same prism as this text). Although we cannot be certain, Sennacherib’s scribes may have inscribed texts intended for Nineveh’s walls on decagonal prisms sometime after 689, thus replacing octagonal prisms (text nos. 15–18) as the principal medium for those texts.   Frahm (Sanherib p. 109), on the basis of the script, suggests that 82-5-22,22 and Rm 2,98 (text no. 32) may have come from the same prism.

In total, ten of Sennacherib’s military expeditions are included in this inscription: his first to eighth campaigns and the campaigns that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695). With regard to work on the armory, Sennacherib describes its decoration in great detail. He records that he: (1)  built a new palace consisting of two wings, one in the Syrian style and one in the Assyrian style, and a large outer courtyard; (2) had bull colossi made from  pendû -stone, a rare and highly coveted reddish-brown stone quarried at Mount Nipur, and white limestone from the city Balāṭāya; (3) erected tall cedar columns on sphinxes made of  pendû -stone; (4) cast large and elaborate objects out of bronze and copper, including human-headed colossi; and (5) constructed an elaborate pillared podium in the outer courtyard. Although the tablet is not dated, its  terminus post quem  is Sennacherib’s eighth campaign, as the military narration ends with an account of the battle of Ḫalulê. Thus, the object was probably inscribed ca. 690–689. This text is sometimes referred to as the “Constantinople Inscription,” “Memorial Tablet,” or “Nebi Yunus Inscription.”    Access  Sennacherib 34  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003508/]    Source:    1 R pls. 43–44  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P450380/]    Commentary   The stone tablet was discovered, with other antiquities, at Nebi Yunus in 1852 (or 1854?) and became the possession of the governor of Mosul; for accounts of the tablet’s discovery, see Rassam, Asshur pp. 4–7 and Budge, By Nile and Tigris 2 pp. 28–29. Fortunately, H. Rassam was allowed to make a copy of the inscription, which he sent to Sir H. Rawlinson; that copy was subsequently published in 1 R (pls. 43–44). Although it was stated in 1 R (pl. 43) that the tablet “is now in the Imperial Museum at Constantinople,” this does not seem to have been the case, since repeated searches in various museums in Istanbul have not uncovered the tablet. E.A.W. Budge (By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 29) also states that he never succeeded in finding the tablet. Thanks are due to V. Donbaz for undertaking yet another search recently. Thus, if it ever did go to Istanbul, and there is no certainty that it did, the tablet is presumably in private hands or simply lost. Thus, the inscription could not be collated and its dimensions remain unknown.   Previous literature (for example, 1 R pls. 43–44 and Budge, By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 28) states that the inscription was written in two columns, with fifty lines of text in col. i and fifty-four lines of text in col. ii. As noted already by E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 128), the tablet was probably inscribed with fifty lines of text on the front and fifty-four lines of text on the back. Compare text no. 35 and text no. 36, both of which are stone tablets that have a single column of text written on the front and back.   Three inscriptions similar to this one are known: (1) text no. 26, which is inscribed on a hexagonal clay prism; (2) text no. 35, which is written on two stone tablets; and (3) a text written on a double-column clay tablet, K 2655 + K 2800 + Sm 318 (+) ?  K 4507 (+) ?  89-4-26,150 (Frahm, Sanherib pp. 202–206 T 173; to be edited in Part 2). Many of the differences between this inscription and those texts are noted in the on-page notes.   In the copy published in 1 R (pls. 43–44), some of the inscription is in light, rather than heavy, type. It is uncertain whether this means that the text is faintly visible or totally missing and therefore restored. In such instances, the relevant passages are placed between half brackets (in the transliteration). The inscription is given consecutive line numbers for the obverse and reverse (= lines 51–94), rather than separate line counts for the obverse and reverse.

Parts of seventy-four lines are preserved and these contain reports of his sixth (against the Chaldeans living in Elam and against Nergal-ušēzib), seventh (against Elam), and eighth (the battle of Ḫalulê) campaigns, an account of a campaign to Arabia, and the beginning of the building report. The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the expedition to Arabia, which took place after Sennacherib’s eighth campaign, and therefore the tablets were probably inscribed ca. 690–689; they are probably later in date than text no. 34. The inscription is sometimes referred to as the “Ungnad Stone Tablet Fragment Inscription” or the “Winckler Stone Tablet Fragment Inscription.” Ex. 1 is named after A. Ungnad, who published a copy of the fragment in 1907, and ex. 2 is named after H. Winckler, who published an edition of that piece in 1893–97.

K 4507 (+) ?  89-4-26,150 (Frahm, Sanherib pp. 202–206 T 173; to be edited in Part 2). Comparison with those texts suggests that this inscription probably contained a short prologue, military narration summarizing Sennacherib’s first to eighth campaigns, the campaigns that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695), and an expedition to Arabia, and a building report. The mention of Sennacherib reviewing enemy booty in line 14'' may indicate that the building account of this text described work on the armory; the reading of the extant text in that line is not entirely certain.   Since exs. 1 and 2 duplicate each other only in lines 10'–30', a score of those lines is provided on the CD-ROM. Although the master text of lines 10'–30' is a conflation of both exemplars, the line divisions follow ex. 1, which was not as wide as ex. 2. Parallel passages in text no. 34 aid in the restoration of damaged text in lines 1'–24' and 40'b–52', although caution must be exercised because there are major variants in those passages. Damaged text in lines 33'–40'a can be restored from text no. 22 v 31–41. For lines 25'–40'a, compare the Baltimore Inscription (Walters Art Gallery no. 41,109) lines 11b–12a, 14, and 41–43 (Grayson, AfO 20 [1963] pp. 88–91); Walters Art Gallery no. 41,109 and a duplicate of it housed at the Catholic University of America, two large stone tablets inscribed in 690 (the king’s 15th regnal year), will be edited in Part 2, since that inscription (which has been referred to as the “Sur-marrati Inscription” and the “Fourteenth Year of Sennacherib Inscription”) records work on the city wall of Sur-marrati and since the tablets upon which this text is written may originate from Samarra, and not Nineveh, where both exemplars of this text are presumed to have been discovered. The inscription is given consecutive line numbers for the obverse and reverse (= lines 32'–15''), rather than separate line counts for the obverse and reverse. Many of the differences between this inscription and text no. 34 are noted in the on-page notes.    Bibliography    1878 G.

The text begins with an invocation of a number of gods (beginning with Aššur and ending with Ištar and the Sebetti). Although the tablet is not dated, its  terminus post quem  is Sennacherib’s second campaign, as the military narration ends with an account of that military expedition.

Thompson during the 1929–30 excavation season at Nineveh, on the Kuyunjik mound between the Nabû and Ištar temples. J. Reade (CRRA 30 pp. 217–218) suggests that the object comes from the Ištar temple. The present location of the tablet is not known, but Thompson said that it was in Baghdad and therefore the object may be in the Iraq Museum (cf. Frame, ARRIM 2 [1984] p. 11). The object is said to be “small,” but its dimensions have not been published.   Like text no. 34 and text no. 35, this tablet is inscribed on both the front and back. Only the left parts of the first seventeen and last twenty-one lines of the inscription are preserved. The text contains a prologue (invocation of gods and Sennacherib’s titles and epithets), reports of the first two campaigns, the  building account (work on some of Nineveh’s temples), and advice to future rulers. Apart from text no. 10 (and probably also text nos. 11–13) and text no. 37, this is the only text in the extant Sennacherib corpus recording work on temples at Nineveh. This text records work on the Sîn-Šamaš temple, the temple of the Lady of Nineveh, and at least one other temple; the building account may have recorded the rebuilding of four, five, or even six different temples. Text no. 10 describes the construction of the shrine of the god Ḫaya and text no. 37 narrates the construction of the  akītu -house Ešaḫulezenzagmukam (“House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year”).

Although only the first fifteen lines and the last eleven lines of the inscription are preserved, it is clear that Sennacherib did not deem the former New Year’s temple, which was situated inside Nineveh (a fact recorded in an inscription of Sennacherib’s grandson Ashurbanipal; see Borger, BIWA p. 169 Prism T v 33–34), suitable for use so he had a new one built outside the city wall, just north of the Nergal Gate; compare also K 1356 (Pongratz-Leisten, Ina Šulmi Īrub pp. 207–209), a text describing this king’s rebuilding of an  akītu -house outside the walls of the city Aššur. The extant text includes Sennacherib’s titles and epithets, his commission as king by the god Aššur, the beginning and end of the building report, and a general description of the annual celebrations in the  akītu -house.

Ross (1848) and E.A.W. Budge (1888–89) in the nineteenth century. In a popular account of his explorations of the ruins of Assyrian cities, A.H. Layard recounts the discovery of ex. 2: “At the foot of the mound Mr. Ross has found a monument of considerable interest. It was first uncovered by a man ploughing. ... It was erect, and supported by brickwork when discovered; and near it was a sarcophagus in baked clay. Mr. Ross suggests that the whole may have been an Assyrian tomb; but I question whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that its original site was where it was found; or that it had not been used, as portions of slabs with inscriptions at Nimroud, by the people who occupied the country after the destruction of the pure Assyrian monuments” (Nineveh 2 pp. 140–141); see also Ross, Letters from the East p. 144 (Letter No. 6, 24 January, 1848). E.A.W. Budge, in an account of his own travels in Ottoman lands, describes the discovery of ex. 1: “The day after my return from Baibûkh a native who farmed a little land between Ḳuyûnjiḳ and Nabi Yûnis came and told me that at a certain spot in one of his fields there was a large flat stone with figures and writing upon it, and he asked me to buy it from him. Taking a few men with digging tools and baskets Nimrûd and I went with him, and in a short time we uncovered a stele about 40 inches high and nearly 20 inches wide” (By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 77). Bezold, reportedly told by Budge, states that ex. 2 was discovered in a field just southeast of the Nebi Yunus mound.   Sennacherib states that he made steles so “there would be no diminution of the royal road” and that he erected the steles “on each side, opposite one another” (lines 19b–21). The credibility of Sennacherib’s claim is supported by the facts that the king faces opposite directions in exs. 1 and 2 (to the right in ex. 1 and to the left in ex. 2), that the farmer who had discovered ex. 1 told Budge that “he had found several such stones and that they had all been broken up and burnt into lime” (Budge, By Nile and Tigris 2 p. 78), and that a third stele was discovered in July 1999 (ex. 3). Ex. 3 was reportedly discovered by a farmer to the southeast of Nebi Yunus; like ex. 2, the image of the king faces to the left.   There is a large blank space between lines 20 and 21 in all three exemplars, but the purpose of this is not known. See the comments in Unger, ABK p. 38.   E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 138) suggests that the steles were completed ca. 690 since text no. 18 vii 50'–51' records in its building report that Sennacherib widened a road of Nineveh to a width of fifty-two cubits, the same width as stated in this text. The steles may have been inscribed earlier (ca. 693–691) since we now know that text no. 18 ex. 1 (BM 127845+) was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-ēmuranni (691). Note also that the 693 and 692 editions of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  that describe work in and around the city of Nineveh, texts written for the city’s walls composed between text no. 17 and text no. 18, are not presently known; those inscriptions may have shed some light on when Sennacherib was working on the royal road.   The text of exs. 1–3 is virtually identical and therefore no score is given on the CD-ROM. The master text is generally ex. 1.

      "text": "The present series of publications, Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP), is intended to present up-to-date editions of the royal inscriptions of a number of Neo-Assyrian rulers. It is modeled on the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) series and carries on where the RIMA (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods) publications ended. The RIM Project was initiated by A. Kirk Grayson at the University of Toronto in 1979 and over the years received extensive support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff. In all, it produced ten volumes in its various sub-series. Grayson retired from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a few years later found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits due to personal and family illnesses. At that time, he handed over responsibility for the work of the project to me, formerly the assistant director and at times acting director of the RIM Project. When I took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and the last RIM volume (RIME 1 by Douglas R. Frayne) appeared in early 2008, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist. Work on several further volumes of inscriptions of Assyrian and Babylonian rulers had already begun during the time of the RIM Project and Grayson passed on responsibility for the materials and manuscripts to me. In 2007, I initiated the current project in order to continue the task of making the official inscriptions of the several important Neo-Assyrian rulers available in modern, scholarly editions. While the volumes in the new series resemble the format of the RIM volumes in most matters, the RINAP volumes include indices of proper names, and editions of the texts are also available online, in connection with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI).     Three volumes have already appeared in this series: RINAP 1, comprising the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V (begun by Hayim Tadmor and completed by Shigeo Yamada); RINAP 3/1, comprising the first part of the inscriptions of Sennacherib (begun by A. Kirk Grayson and completed by his collaborator Jamie Novotny); and RINAP 4, comprising the inscriptions of Esarhaddon (by Erle Leichty, with a contribution by Grant Frame). The complete corpus of the royal inscriptions of Sennacherib is presented in two parts, with the present volume being the second part (RINAP 3/2, by A. Kirk Grayson and Jamie Novotny); the first part, also by Grayson and Novotny, appeared in 2012. With the collaboration of Andreas Fuchs for two texts, I am preparing RINAP 2, the inscriptions of Sargon II. In addition, Jamie Novotny and Greta Van Buylaere are currently carrying out work on the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal and his successors Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarru-iškun.     The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the RINAP Project research grants in 2008, 2010, and 2012 to help carry out its work and my thanks must be expressed to it. My appreciation must also be extended to the University of Pennsylvania, where the project is based in the Babylonian Section of its Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.      Philadelphia, February 2014   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "The history of the Sennacherib project has been outlined in the preface to RINAP 3/1 as have the labors of the authors. We are once again extremely grateful to the individuals and institutions named in that preface for their past contributions and continuing support which has gone into the preparation of RINAP 3/2.    The penultimate manuscript of RINAP 3/2 was read by Andreas Fuchs, Greta Van Buylaere, and Martin Worthington, all of whom made numerous astute comments, welcome criticisms, and improvements, particularly on the transliterations and translations. In addition, members of the RINAP editorial board and the project consultants offered helpful suggestions at various times near the completion of the volume. Their time, care, and generosity are greatly appreciated.     We would like to thank the student and post-doctoral assistants who helped in the completion of the volume: Joshua Jeffers, Andrew Knapp, and Irene Sibbing Plantholt. The authors are grateful to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Chicago), the Trustees of the British Museum, and the Vorderasiatisches Museum for allowing us to publish photographs of objects bearing Sennacherib inscriptions, as well as to J.M. Russell, who graciously gave us permission to include his personal photographs of in situ objects in the South-West Palace at Nineveh in this volume. Also, we would like to thank Grant Frame for bringing to our attention several unpublished copies of P.E. Botta now in the Archives of the Institut de France and to Alan R. Millard for providing us with a legible photograph of BM 91157 (text no. 193), a piece of bronze with a hitherto unknown inscription of Sennacherib.     The authors’ appreciation goes out once again to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania, and several private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff and Malcolm Horsnell, whose financial support allowed for the authors’ travel to numerous museums and provided the funding necessary for them to conduct the research in Sennacherib’s inscriptions and to publish this volume.     Last, but by no means least, the authors wish to record their gratitude for the ongoing support and encouragement of their families: Eunice Grayson†, Vera and Sally Grayson, and six grandchildren — Mariek, Milena, Corin, Margot, Helen, and Lydia; Denise Bolton, Robert and Diana Novotny, and Jennifer Novotny.

      "text": "The volumes in the RINAP series are modeled upon the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project, with a few modifications, in particular the addition of indices of proper names. Like the RIM volumes, the volumes in this series are not intended to provide analytical or synthetic studies, but rather to provide basic text editions that can serve as the foundations for such studies. Thus, extensive discussions of the contents of the texts are not presented, and the core of each volume is the edition of the relevant texts.     In this volume, the order of the texts is based for the most part upon the following two criteria:   (1) The city at which the structure dealt with in the building or dedicatory portion of the text was located. If that information is not preserved on the text, the provenance of the inscribed object is the determining factor.    (2) The type of object upon which the inscription is written (prism, cylinder, tablet, etc.).     Following the practice of the RIM series, inscriptions that cannot be assigned definitely to a particular ruler are given text numbers beginning at 1001. Certain other inscriptions that provide information relevant for establishing royal names and titles (e.g. “servant seals”) and any composed in the name of another member of the royal family (e.g., royal wives) have been given numbers that begin at 2001.     In the volumes of the RINAP series, the term “exemplar” is employed to designate a single inscription found on one object. The term “text” is employed to refer to an inscription that existed in antiquity and that may be represented by a number of more or less duplicate exemplars. In these editions exemplars of one text are edited together as a “master text,” with a single transliteration and translation. Variants to the “master text” are provided either on page (major variants) or at the back of the volume (minor variants).     Each text edition is normally supplied with a brief introduction containing general information. This is followed by a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars. This includes museum and excavation numbers (the symbol + is added between fragments that belong to the same object), provenance, dimensions of the object, lines preserved, and indication of whether or not the inscription has been collated (c = collated with the original, p = collated by means of a photograph, (p) = partially collated from a photograph; and n = not collated). The next section is normally a commentary containing further technical information and notes. The bibliography then follows. Items are arranged chronologically, earliest to latest, with notes in parentheses after each item. These notes indicate the exemplars with which the item is concerned and the nature of the publication, using the following key words: provenance, photo, copy, edition, translation, catalogue, and study. Certain standard reference works (e.g., the various volumes of “Keilschriftbibliographie” and “Register Assyriologie” published in Orientalia and Archiv für Orientforschung respectively; Borger, HKL 1–3; AHw; CAD; and Seux, ERAS) are not normally cited, although they were essential in the collecting and editing of these texts. While the bibliographies should contain all major relevant items, they are not necessarily totally exhaustive; a vast amount of scattered literature exists on many of the inscriptions edited in this volume and much of this literature is of only limited scholarly interest.     As noted earlier, a distinction is made between major and minor variants to a “master text”; the major variants are placed at the bottom of the page and the minor variants at the back of the book. In brief, major variants are essentially non-orthographic in nature, while minor variants are orthographic variations. Orthographic variants of proper names may at times be significant and thus on occasion these will also appear on the page as major variants. Complete transliterations of all exemplars in the style of musical scores are found on the CD-ROMs accompanying the volumes and thus any reader who finds the notes on variants insufficient for his/her needs may check the full reading of any exemplar. Such scores, however, are not normally given for bricks and seal inscriptions. Objects whose attribution to a particular text is not entirely certain are given exemplar numbers that are followed by an asterisk (*); for example, Ass 365 is regarded as text no. 181 ex. 1*, since it is uncertain that it is a duplicate of Ass 282 (text no. 181 ex. 1). Moreover, these exemplars are listed in separate catalogues (Catalogue of Uncertain Exemplars), beneath the main catalogue. Moreover, the numbering of the “exemplars” of some of the inscriptions, mostly those on the human-headed colossi (text nos. 39–50) and on rock faces (text no. 223), requires explanation because of the unusual nature of the source material. In numerous instances in this volume, a “text” is known only from one or more nineteenth-century (draft and/or published) copies. In most of these cases, the actual inscriptions themselves are no longer available for firsthand study since the originals were left in the field; some remain buried to this day and/or have been subsequently destroyed. Each hand-drawn facsimile of a single “text” is regarded as a different version of the same “exemplar” because the copies all stem from the same inscribed object. For these texts, each copy is assigned the same “exemplar” number, but with a different lowercase letter appended to it to differentiate the various sources of information about what is on the exemplar. Text no. 223 (the so-called Bavian Inscription), for example, is known from three exemplars, with each of those exemplars being either fully or partially copied by A.H. Layard and being copied in their entirety by L.W. King. Because the hand-drawn facsimiles of each exemplar stem from the same ancient source — an inscribed and sculpted rounded-top niche carved into the side of a cliff — the various copies are regarded as one exemplar. Thus, for example, exs. 1a, 1b, and 1c are Layard’s unpublished draft copies of the “central panel” at Bavian and ex. 1d is King’s unpublished draft facsimile of the same panel at Bavian. This system of numbering was first introduced in Tadmor and Yamada, RINAP 1 and is used here for text nos. 39, 42–44, 46, 53–55, 62, and 223; see the commentaries for more specific information relating to the known sources.    Several photographs, plans, and drawings are included in this volume. These are intended to show a few of the object types upon which Sennacherib’s inscriptions were written and to aid the reader in understanding the provenance, composition, and/or current state of preservation of some the inscriptions.     As is the normal practice for transliterating cuneiform inscriptions, lower case Roman is used for Sumerian and lower case italics for Akkadian; logograms in Akkadian texts appear in capitals. The system of sign values in Borger, Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon, is generally followed. Italics in the English translation indicate either an uncertain translation or a word in the original language. In general, the rendering of personal names follows the PNA; however, the names of Babylonian rulers follow the spelling used in RIMB 2.    There are several differences between the RIM and RINAP styles. Among these, the most notable is that all partially preserved or damaged signs, regardless of how they are broken, now appear between half brackets (⌜ and ⌝). Thus, no partially preserved sign has square brackets ([ and ]) inserted in its transliteration; for example, [DINGI]R and LUGA[L KU]R appear in the transliteration as ˹DINGIR˺ and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ respectively. This change was made to ensure compatibility of the online RINAP editions with the standards of the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), the parent site and project where RINAP Online is housed. This change was implemented in the print version in order to present identical editions in RINAP 1 and RINAP Online. Note, however, that the translations may appear more damaged than their corresponding transliterations indicate, as the translations were prepared according to standard Assyriological practices; for example, ˹DINGIR˺ (= [DINGI]R) and ˹LUGAL KUR˺ (= LUGA[L KU]R) are translated as “[the go]d” and “king [of the lan]d,” and not “the god” and “king of the land.”     In addition to the indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications found in RIM volumes, the RINAP volumes also contain indices of proper names (personal names, topographical names and divine names). Online versions of the manuscripts are maintained by CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative) and are fully searchable.     Philadelphia, February 2014   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "On the twentieth of Ṭebētu (X) 681, near the end of his twenty-fourth year as king of Assyria, the sixty-something-year-old Sennacherib was murdered by one or more of his sons and the latter’s accomplices. [1]  The king’s violent death, which threw Assyria briefly into civil war, has been a subject of debate in Assyriology even though numerous contemporary and later sources (including the Bible and classical authors) record the event. Cuneiform sources (inscriptions of Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal, and Nabonidus, and Babylonian chronicles) do not name the culprit(s), stating only that the king was killed by his son, and the biblical (2 Kings 19:37; Isaiah 37:38; and 2 Chronicles 32:21) and classical (Berossus,  Babyloniaca  and Josephus,  Ant. Jud. ) accounts provide the name of the murderer(s) in garbled/distorted forms; see the section  Family, Succession Arrangement, and Sennacherib’s Murder in 681  below. [2] Those involved in the regicide profited for only a short time, as by the beginning of Addaru (XII), less than two months later, the heir designate, Esarhaddon, entered Nineveh, chased off the remaining plotters and insurgents, and ascended the throne of Assyria, just as his father had arranged a few years earlier (683 or slightly earlier). [3]  Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon, grandson Ashurbanipal, and great-grandsons Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarru-iškun ruled over Assyria (and occasionally Babylonia) until 612, when forces led by the Neo-Babylonian king Nabopolassar and the Median ruler Cyaxares (Umakištar) besieged Nineveh and after three months sacked and destroyed it, thus effectively bringing Assyrian kingship to an end. [4]  Although Assyria disappeared as a political entity ca. 609, Sennacherib’s name and deeds lived on, never to be forgotten.      Some aspects of Sennacherib’s reign and his inscriptions have already been discussed in the introduction to Part 1 and that information will not be addressed here. For a survey of the inscribed objects included in Part 1, an overview of previous editions, studies of his military campaigns and building activities at Nineveh, information on the chronology of the reign, and translations of relevant passages in king lists and chronicles, see Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/1 pp. 1–27. The introduction to Part 2 will include information on texts included in Part 2 and texts excluded from RINAP 3; a survey of the inscribed objects included in Part 2; tables providing information on the king’s military campaign; a study of Sennacherib’s numerous building activities (especially his waterworks and work undertaken at Aššur); a study of Sennacherib’s family, succession arrangement(s), and murder in 681; and a chart giving the dates or proposed dates of the inscriptions edited in this volume. For information about his character, innovations (in metal-working, hydrology, art, etc.), and (military and religious) reforms, see in particular Dalley and Oleson, Technology and Culture 44 (2003) pp. 1–26; Frahm, Sanherib pp. 19–20 and 277–288; Frahm, PNA 3/1 pp. 1123–1124 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība III; and Frahm, RLA 12/1–2 (2009) pp. 18–19 §§6, 6.1.2 and p. 21 §8; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 117–119; and Vera Chamaza, Omnipotenz, pp. 111–167 §2.3.         Notes      1  The date of the king’s murder is provided in a Babylonian chronicle (Grayson, Chronicles p. 81 no. 1 iii 34–35a). Because his eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi was old enough to become king of Babylon in 700, S. Parpola (LAS 2 p. 231 n. 390) and E. Frahm (PNA 3/1 p. 1113 I.1) suggest that Sennacherib was born around 745. A. Fuchs (RLA 12/1–2 [2009] p. 53 §3) suggests the year 740 as his approximate date of birth.       2   Grayson (CAH 2  3/2 pp. 119 and 121) has stated earlier that the “identity of the murderer or murderers is not certain, and the circumstances of the assassination remain one of the great mysteries of ancient history” and that “the murder of Sennacherib, the circumstances surrounding it, and the causes leading up to it, are unsolved puzzles.”      3  In his own inscriptions, Esarhaddon states that he entered Nineveh on the eighth of Addaru (XII), but a Babylonian chronicle records that the unrest in Assyria ended on the second of that month and that Esarhaddon ascended the throne of Assyria on either the eighteenth or twenty-eighth of Addaru. See respectively Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 14 Esarhaddon 1 i 87–ii 2; and Grayson, Chronicles pp. 81–82 no. 1 iii 36–38.      4  Assyria remained as a (weak) political entity until ca. 609. According to a Babylonian chronicle, Aššur-uballiṭ II declared himself king of Assyria in the city Ḫarrān after the death or capture of Sîn-šarru-iškun. Apart from the information provided in that chronographic text, which records a few battles between him and Babylonian and Median armies, nothing about Assyria’s last king is known. After the chronicle entry for the year 609 (the seventh year of Nabopolassar), Aššur-uballiṭ disappears from the written record. See Grayson, Chronicles pp. 94–96 no. 3 lines 49b–75."

      "text": "As already stated in the introduction of Part 1, the division of the Sennacherib corpus into two volumes is somewhat arbitrary as the authors have tried to maintain a balance between Part 1 and Part 2 by including major, well-preserved inscriptions in both volumes. Thirty-eight individual texts of Sennacherib were edited in Part 1, whereas the rest of the corpus, one hundred and ninety-five texts, as well as twenty-six other late Neo-Assyrian inscriptions that might belong to this king and two inscriptions of some of his family members (including his wife Tašmētu-šarrat) are edited here. Part 1 included all historical inscriptions on clay cylinders, clay prisms, and stone tablets from Nineveh, as well as stone steles recording the creation of a royal road. Part 2, this volume, contains historical inscriptions on bull and lion colossi from Nineveh, rock reliefs, stone horizontal prisms, and clay cylinders and prisms from other cities under Sennacherib’s authority (especially Aššur and Tarbiṣu); epigraphs on reliefs; and inscriptions on bricks, threshold slabs, door sockets, wall slabs, stone blocks, beads, and metal plating; as well as drafts and archival copies of historical and building inscriptions written on clay tablets. Note that the order of texts presented here deviates significantly from Frahm, Sanherib; the interested reader can consult the concordance of selected publications at the back of the book for details. Three major differences in the arrangement of the corpus are: (1) texts written on clay tablets (text nos. 135–163) in the Kuyunjik collections of the British Museum are placed at the end of the section dealing with Nineveh rather than at the end of the book (cf. Frahm, Sanherib pp. 194–229 T 169–187); (2) the texts from Judi Dagh, Bavian, Jerwan, Sūr-murrati, and the vicinity of Arbela (text nos. 222–230) are placed near the end of the certain Sennacherib inscriptions rather than between the texts from Nineveh and Aššur (cf. Frahm, Sanherib pp. 150–162 T 116–128); and (3) the order of the texts at Nineveh (excluding the tablets from Kuyunjik) and Aššur (text nos. 39–134 and 164–209 respectively) is arranged by object type rather than by the structure whose building/renovation the text commemorates (cf. Frahm, Sanherib pp. 112–149 T 25–115 and pp. 163–185 T 129–158). All of the known inscriptions are written in Akkadian, usually in Standard Babylonian (rarely in Assyrian); no Sumerian inscriptions of Sennacherib are extant. One Akkadian inscription has an Aramaic note with it (text no. 211). The script is usually Neo-Assyrian or a mixture of Assyrian and Babylonian sign forms in the case of inscriptions written on stone; one inscription (text no. 158), however, is written in contemporary Neo-Babylonian script."

Lastly, the Assyrian relief from Shakaft-i Gulgul (Grayson and Levine, Iranica Antiqua 11 [1975] pp. 29–38) is not included here since that relief and its inscription were probably commissioned by Sennacherib’s grandson and second successor Ashurbanipal; it is planned to edit that text as a 1000-number of Ashurbanipal."

      "text": "Clay Cylinders     Clay Prisms     Clay Cones     Clay Tablets       The corpus of firmly identifiable Sennacherib inscriptions currently comprises two hundred and thirty-three texts; twenty-six late Neo-Assyrian inscriptions which may be attributed to Sennacherib, although some arbitrarily, are also edited here (text nos. 1001–1026). One text is ascribed to a wife of his, Tašmētu-šarrat (text no. 2002) and another to a woman close to him, possibly his mother (text no. 2001); eight inscriptions of another wife of his, Naqīʾa (Zakūtu), are known but all of these appear to have been written during the reign of his son and immediate successor, Esarhaddon, and have been edited in Leichty, RINAP 4. Inscriptions of Sennacherib, including those edited in Part 1, are presently found on a wide variety of clay, stone, and metal objects, specifically:        Object Type   Text No.   Clay cylinders    1–13, 213   Clay prisms    14–33, 164–165   Clay cones    214   Clay tablets    135–163, 209, 1015–1023   Clay objects (prisms or tablets)     1024–1026   Bricks     88–101, 195–208, 216–217, 219–221   Horizontal stone prisms     166   Stone tablets     34–37, 168, 230–231   Stone human-headed bull colossi     39, 41–47, 49–50   Stone human-headed lion colossi     40, 48, 51 (ex. 3)    Wall slabs (including slabs with reliefs)     51 (exs. 1–2), 53–77, 80–85, 215   Threshold slabs    78–79, 218   Stone blocks (including horse troughs) and paving stones    132 (horse troughs), 169–189, 224–229, 232   Stone door sockets    86–87, 190–191   Sculpted stone water basin    192   Stone vessels (various types)     133–134, 1002–1010, 2002   Small stone objects, including cylinder-shaped beads    102–131, 210, 233, 1011–1014   Cylinder seals (including impressions)     212   Steles    38, 167, 1001, 2001   Rock faces    222–223   Stone (uncertain)     52   Metal platings    193–194   Bronze lion weight    211           Clay Cylinders    Two clay cylinders discovered in Egallammes (“Palace, Warrior of the Netherworld”), the Nergal temple at Tarbiṣu (modern Sherif Khan), are inscribed with one of the earliest known inscriptions of Sennacherib. The Tarbiṣu recension of the First Campaign Cylinder (text no. 213), although not dated, likely comes from the first half of 702, Sennacherib’s 3rd regnal year, and describes in great detail a campaign against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and an account of the rebuilding of Egallammes, which was reported to have been in a dilapidated state. The prologue and military narration are nearly identical to the Nineveh version of the First Campaign Cylinder (text no. 1).         Clay Prisms   In addition to the octagonal clay prisms that are inscribed with copies of inscriptions commemorating Sennacherib’s construction at Nineveh (text no. 15 exs. 6, 14, and 17, and text no. 16 exs. 23* and 28*–32*), there are at least two texts (text nos. 164–165) written on octagonal prisms discovered at Aššur that describe construction at Aššur. Unfortunately, both inscriptions are very badly damaged. The first inscription (text no. 164) is preserved on a complete but badly effaced octagonal prism, whose entire surface is very worn, making it nearly impossible to read most of the text inscribed upon it. However, enough of the text can be deciphered to be certain that it included a short prologue, reports of Sennacherib’s first eight campaigns, and a short, fifteen-line building account. That passage records the renovation of the innermost part of one of palaces at Aššur (the so-called Old Palace), a royal residence previously worked on by Tiglath-pileser I (1114–1076) and Ashurnasirpal II (883–859). The scribe who inscribed the prism did not date the object; this is unusual since the Nineveh prisms and the Aššur copies of those Nineveh texts were dated. Since its  terminus post quem  is the battle of Ḫalulê, during the king’s eighth campaign (691), the date of composition is ca. 691–689, around the same time as the Chicago Prism (text no. 22 ex. 1), the Jerusalem Prism (text no. 23 ex. 1), and the Taylor Prism (text no. 22 ex. 2). The second inscription (text no. 165) is in even worse condition, with parts of only the first three columns and the eighth column still extant. Although only sections of the first three campaigns are preserved, we can be certain that the military narration of the inscription contained reports of at least Sennacherib’s first four campaigns; the earliest prisms of this king date to 698, Sennacherib’s 7th regnal year, the year after reports of the four campaigns were first included in the military narration of inscriptions. The final twenty-two lines of the inscription, part of the building report, are preserved, but they are very badly damaged and difficult to read. That passage may describe Sennacherib’s restoration of Aššur’s walls and gates. [5]  The scribe of this prism did not put a date on the object and, therefore, it is not known with certainty when this octagonal prism was inscribed. Based on the amount of space available and on the assumption that the building report did not occupy more than the lower part of the eighth column, the military narration of this inscription may have ended with the sixth (694–693), seventh (late 693), or eighth (691) campaign. In addition to these two inscriptions, there were presumably other (no longer extant)  texts of Sennacherib written on clay prisms that included military narration and a report of construction at Aššur.       Clay Cones   It has been remarked that clay cones “are certainly the most unusual of the variety of objects upon which Assyrian royal inscriptions were inscribed. Unlike bricks, statues, reliefs, and even clay tablets, the form and function of which are immediately recognizable, the clay cones do not fit any pattern to our modern minds.” [6]  Moreover, “cone” — or “knob,” “boss,” “peg” or “nail” as used in other scholarly literature — is not really an adequate translation of the Akkadian word  sikkatu , the term for these objects that appears regularly in the corpus of Assyrian royal inscriptions. Although there is quite a diversity in the shape of these  sikkatu , the cones all have a tapered shaft that comes almost to a point and a large, hollow, semi-spherical head; the shaft was sometimes inserted into the center of a decorated clay plate and the combined cone and plate were placed in the interior room of a building with the plate flat against the wall and the head of the cone protruding. [7]  The cones themselves, like their companion plates, could be enameled with a variety of colors (black, white, yellow, brown, red, green, and blue).   Fragments of the heads of two cones of Sennacherib (text no. 214) are known and both pieces are presumed to have come from Tarbiṣu. Both cones were inscribed with the same short, two-line text stating that Sennacherib rebuilt the Nergal temple Egallammes in that city from its foundations to its crenellations and that the king deposited clay cones in the structure of that temple. Although these cones do not bear dates, the text written upon them was composed very early in Sennacherib’s reign, around the time the Tarbiṣu recension of the First Campaign Cylinder (text no. 213) was being written on clay cylinders (ca. early 702); the date is suggested by the fact that this is when Sennacherib was renovating Nergal’s temple.          Clay Tablets    Of all of the known objects inscribed with the inscriptions of Sennacherib, those written on tablets (text nos. 135–163 and 209) are in some ways the most difficult to assess. Specifically, what were the immediate circumstances that led to them being written on this clay medium? Were they intended to be drafts of texts written on other media, including clay cylinders, clay prisms, stone tablets, stone human-headed colossi, niches in rock cliffs, or metal plating? Were they intended to be archival copies or a record of texts deposited or found in the mud-brick structure of buildings or walls? Were they scribal training exercises? Or did they have some other purpose? Given the fragmentary state of preservation of the known tablets with inscriptions of Sennacherib, this is not always an easy question to answer; in a few instances, however, it is. Moreover, it is uncertain how many tablets of his are extant; there could be as few as twenty-two tablets, if certain non-physical joins prove correct, or as many as thirty different tablets. All but one of these, text no. 209, which originates from Aššur, are presumed to have come from Nineveh. [8]  The size, shape, and format of the tablets vary. The following types are known: (1) narrow single-column tablets (text nos. 135, 142, 153–155, 158–159, 161, and 163); (2) short, wide single-column tablets (text nos. 140–141 and 146–148); (3)  uʾiltu -tablets, with rounded corners (text nos. 149–150, 152, 156–157, and 160); [9]  and (4) multi-column tablets, with two (text nos. 143–145, 151, and 162) or three (text nos. 136–139) columns per side.       As is to be expected from the number of tablets/fragments, their contents vary. Five tablets are inscribed with a text containing (1) a prologue (which includes the king’s name, titles/epithets, and a statement of the god Aššur’s support for his earthly representative), (2) military narration, (3) a building report, and (4) concluding formulae (text nos. 135, 136–139, 140–141, 142, 143–145, and 151). [10]  Text nos. 146–148, assuming all three fragments belong to the same tablet and that tablet is not part of a series of two or more tablets, appear to contain (1) military narration, (2) a building report, and (3) concluding formulae. Two tablets (text nos. 149–150) contain copies, mostly likely drafts, of epigraphs; some of the epigraphs on these tablets are written in Neo-Assyrian, rather than Standard Babylonian. One tablet (text no. 152) contains a copy of a text comprising (1) a prologue and (2) a building report. Text nos. 153–155, assuming all three fragments come from the same tablet which is either an archival copy or a draft of an inscription written on a rock cliff, include (1) an invocation of deities; (2) Sennacherib’s name, titles, and epithets; (3) a statement about the god Aššur supporting Sennacherib as his earthly representative; (4) a building account; and (5) concluding formulae. Due to the fragmentary nature of that tablet, it is not known if that inscription also contained military narration; compare the contents of the Bavian Inscription (text no. 223), which is discussed below in the section on steles and rock reliefs. One tablet (text no. 156) contains copies of three texts that were written on a lapis lazuli cylinder seal, while another tablet (text no. 157) contains drafts of two texts that were to be inscribed on small cylinder-shaped beads; see below for details on those tablets’ contents. Two tablets (text nos. 158 and 160) contain texts that are probably epigraphs that accompanied images. One of those tablets (text no. 158) also has a narrative inscription written on it; that text is a prayer to the god Aššur to ensure the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of Sennacherib’s reign. Lastly, three tablets (text nos. 159 and 161–162) contain dedicatory inscriptions. Although these texts are all fragmentarily preserved, they contain: (1) a dedication to the god Aššur (listing his titles and epithets); (2) Sennacherib’s name, titles, and epithets; (3) a building report describing the object being dedicated; and (4) concluding formulae. There is one other tablet (text no. 163), but it is not sufficiently preserved for us to be able to confidently remark on its contents, other than that they are similar to those of the “Sin of Sargon” text (Livingstone, SAA 3 pp. 77–79 no. 33; and Tadmor, Landsberger, and Parpola, SAAB 3 [1989] pp. 3–52).     The function/purpose of these tablets, as mentioned above, is not always clear. The contents of some texts, especially those written on  uʾiltu -tablets with rounded corners (text nos. 149–150, 152, 156–157, and 160), appear to have been drafts of inscriptions that were to be written on other media, including sculpted wall slabs. The crudely-made nature of some of the tablets, as well as the use of Neo-Assyrian in the case of one text (text no. 149), are the principal pieces of evidence that suggest that some texts were first or early drafts of inscriptions. Probably numerous drafts were not approved by the king (or by his chief scribe, who may have vetted compositions before they were presented to Sennacherib) to be used on clay, stone, or metal objects deposited or displayed in temples, royal residences, walls, or open-air (public) venues. The best example is perhaps K 1280 (text no. 149), which is a crudely-made  uʾiltu -tablet inscribed with six epigraphs, including one written in Neo-Assyrian (obv. 1–9). Because Neo-Assyrian is not used for epigraphs on Sargonid palace reliefs, it is very doubtful that that text was used as an epigraph on a sculpted wall slab in the “Palace Without a Rival”; [11]  if it was used, it probably would have been reworked, including being rewritten in Standard Babylonian. Some of the other drafts may have been final revisions that were approved to be inscribed on other objects. Sm 1893 (text no. 157), a small horizontal tablet which contains the draft of two texts to be inscribed on small cylinder-shaped beads, best illustrates this. The opening lines of the tablet (obv. 1–2) clearly indicate that Sennacherib had ordered that the texts on that tablet were to be inscribed on other objects (beads). Because the king is ordering the writing of those texts, the drafts must have been regarded as final drafts; the language and content are consistent with other inscriptions written on cylinder-shaped beads (see the discussion below). [12]  K 1356 (text no. 160), which contains an extremely interesting text recording the construction of an  akītu -house outside the western wall of the city Aššur and several epigraphs that were to accompany images on the temple’s bronze gate (a work of art depicting an epic battle between Aššur and his entourage on the one hand and Tiāmat and her horde of monsters on the other hand), may have also been a final or near final draft. Because relatively few metal objects inscribed with texts of Assyrian kings survive today, there is no way to know if the texts written on K 1356 were copied verbatim on that  akītu -house’s elaborately decorated bronze gate or if later, revised versions of those texts were copied there. Given the lack of evidence, we can only speculate on this matter. It is noteworthy that these tablets containing drafts have survived; they appear to have been archived rather than destroyed.     For the majority of the tablets with Sennacherib inscriptions (text nos. 142, 146–148, 151, 153–155, 158, 159, and 163), it is not clear if they were archival copies of texts on objects officially commissioned by the king or whether they were final drafts that were archived after the objects for which those texts were intended were inscribed; thus, those tablets may have been either archival copies or final drafts that were archived. Subscripts ( Abschriftvermerke ) preserved on some of these tablets are useful in that they provide information about the location and sometimes the object upon which the text was to be written. Unfortunately, most of the subscripts that are regarded as being written during Sennacherib’s own reign are either completely destroyed (text no. 142, 151, 158, and 159) or are poorly preserved (text nos. 146–148 and 153–155). [13]  The one intact subscript (K 4732 + Sm 1081 = text no. 163 rev. 1'–4') records that that text was to be written on stone slabs placed in the Aššur temple at Aššur, slabs upon which the king was to stand while kissing the ground. It is not clear, however, if the contents of the tablet were copied from those slabs and then archived or whether K 4732+ was used to inscribe those now-lost slabs and then archived. Another example illustrating the ambiguity of archival copy or draft (and then archival copy) is K 100 (+) ?  DT 166 (+) ?  Rm 403 (text nos. 153–155), a fragmentarily preserved single-column tablet inscribed with a text that is similar in passages to the Bavian Inscription (text no. 223; see below). Since a copy of that text has not yet been discovered written in a niche carved into the face of a rock cliff, it is possible that the text on K 100+ was: (1) a rejected (near) final draft that was supplanted by another text; (2) a (near) final draft that was to be written in niches carved into the face of a cliff, but the actual task of carving them was never executed; or (3) a final draft that was archived after Sennacherib had rock relief panels inscribed with that text. [14]  In sum, we can only speculate on the original reason for K 100+ being inscribed.      One tablet, K 2673 (text no. 156), was probably intended to be an archival copy of the three texts that were inscribed on a royal seal of lapis lazuli. Certainly two of the inscriptions (the ones of the Babylonian king Šagarakti-Šuriaš and the Middle Assyrian ruler Tukultī-Ninurta I) were copied directly from the object itself; see the section on other stone objects below for further details. The circumstances that led to the Sennacherib inscription being written on K 2655 + K 2800 + Sm 318 (+) ?  K 4507 (+) ?  Bu 89-4-26,150 (text nos. 143–145) are very uncertain since that tablet also has royal decrees of Šamšī-Adad V and Adad-nārārī III written on it. Was this tablet a scribal practice tablet or was there some other reason that most of an inscription of Sennacherib was written on the same tablet as decrees of earlier Assyrian kings? [15]  Unfortunately, we simply do not know the answer to this question and the purpose of K 2655+ remains illusive.     It is clear from orthography, slips in phraseology, writing peculiarities and the use of expressions not typical of, or otherwise known in, inscriptions composed during the reign of Sennacherib that some texts of Sennacherib were copied onto tablets (text nos. 135, 136-139, 140-141, and 161-162) during the reigns of Esarhaddon and/or Ashurbanipal; the scribes did not always faithfully copy the original inscriptions. [16]  The reason that many of these texts were copied is not obvious, apart from the fact that the scribes of Esarhaddon and/or Ashurbanipal deemed it necessary to keep a record of (some) texts of Sennacherib that had been discovered by workmen in the structure of buildings/walls they were rebuilding or renovating. The fate of the originals, whether they were returned to where they were found and placed alongside Esarhaddon’s and/or Ashurbanipal’s own inscriptions (as is claimed in the concluding formulae of numerous texts) or deposited in an archive after they were copied (that is, not returned to their original location), is not certain. An example of this is the text written on K 2662 (+) ?  K 3752 (+) ?  K 11718 (+) ?  DT 200 (text nos. 136-139). The inscription appears to have been originally inscribed on clay cylinders or clay prisms that were deposited in the structure of the citadel wall of Nineveh. When Ashurbanipal (or Esarhaddon) rebuilt sections of that wall, those inscribed objects were discovered. The text was copied more or less verbatim from one of those cylinders/prisms and K 2662+ is the resulting copy, as noted by the subscript, which reads “that which is upon the inscribed object that [...]; belonging to Senn[acherib, ...].” [17]  Ashurbanipal claims to have placed inscriptions of his grandfather back where his workman had discovered them; whether or not this is true remains to be proven by the archaeological record.     On at least two occasions, Ashurbanipal had inscriptions of his grandfather removed from objects before having those same objects refurbished and reinscribed with his own texts. Those texts were copied onto tablets before the inscriptions were destroyed. K 8664 (text no. 161) and K 2411 (text no. 162) are the products of those events, as indicated by their subscripts. The subscript of K 8664 (rev. 9'–11') reads:   “Wording (of the inscription) that (is) on the bed (and) the throne at the footend.  It is a single  ( text ). The one on the chest was not copied.”    The subscript of K 2411 (iii 36'–40'), which provides information about the texts themselves, reads:    “Wording (of the inscription) that was cut off (and) erased from the bed (and) the throne of the god Bēl (Marduk) that were in the temple of (the god) Aššur (and that of the inscription) written upon (them) in the name of Ashurbanipal. Simānu (III), twenty-seventh day, eponymy of Awiānu (655), [they were] re[turned [to] Ba[byl]on.”    In 655 (Ashurbanipal’s 14th regnal year), Ashurbanipal returned to Babylon the pleasure bed of Marduk and Zarpanītu that his grandfather Sennacherib had taken to Assyria and dedicated to the god Aššur after he had looted Esagil in 689 (Sennacherib’s 16th regnal year); the bed was placed in Kaḫilisu, the bed chamber of the goddess Zarpanītu. That  musukkannu -wood bed needed to be refurbished before it was sent back from the city of Aššur. Ashurbanipal had his scribes copy onto tablets the inscription that Sennacherib had written on its gold plating before having that text removed from the metal plating and replaced with his own commemorative text. It would have been offensive to the god Marduk to have sent that bed back with an inscription dedicated to Aššur on it. Ashurbanipal did the same thing with Marduk’s throne. In addition to making copies of his grandfather’s inscriptions, Ashurbanipal had his scribes write out detailed descriptions of the objects. K 8664 is probably the original copy that Ashurbanipal had his scribe make before having Sennacherib’s inscription removed from Marduk’s pleasure bed and throne, while K 2411 is likely a later copy of the contents of K 8664, with the addition of Ashurbanipal’s replacement inscription.          Notes       5  Frahm, KAL 3 p. 33.      6  Donbaz and Grayson, RICCA p. 1.      7  For further details on cones and plates (with references to earlier studies, photographs, and drawings), see Donbaz and Grayson, RICCA pp. 1–4; and Nunn, Knaufplatten. The majority of the known Assyrian clay cones come from Aššur.      8  The number of tablets cited above refers only to tablets with positively identified Sennacherib inscriptions. In addition, there are several other texts on clay tablets or fragments of clay tablets that might come from his reign (text nos. 1015–1023), but their attribution to Sennacherib is uncertain. R. Borger (BAL 2  p. 88) and E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 195–211 and 215–217 T 170–T 171, T 173–T 174, and T 179) suggest the following texts originate from a single tablet: (1) text nos. 136, 137, 138, and 139; (2) text nos. 140 and 141; (3) text nos. 143, 144, and 145; (4) text nos. 146, 147, and 148; and (5) text nos. 153, 154, and 155. Because one cannot be absolutely certain that the non-physically joined fragments all belong to the same tablet, the authors have tentatively edited the fragments individually. However, for the sake of clarity, in the discussion of clay tablets here we will treat text nos. 136–139, text nos. 140–141, text nos. 143–145, text nos. 146–148, and text nos. 153–155 as if they were from five different tablets, rather than from fifteen tablets.       9  For some details on this horizontal tablet format (1:2 ratio), see Radner, Nineveh 612 BC pp. 72–73 (with fig. 8).       10  The building reports and concluding formulae of the texts written on K 2655 + K 2800 + Sm 318 (+) ?  K 4507 (+) ?  Bu 89-4-26,150 (text nos. 143–145) and K 2627 + K 2666 + K 2676 (+) ?  DT 320 (text nos. 140–141) appear not to have been copied on the tablets.       11  For the same opinion, see also Frahm, Sanherib pp. 211–212 T 175.      12  For a discussion of this text, see Grayson and Ruby, Iraq 59 (1997) pp. 89–91.      13  See below for information on the subscripts written on K 2662 (+) ?  K 3752 (+) ?  K 11718 (+) ?  DT 200 (text nos. 136–139), K 8664 (text no. 161) and K 2411 (text no. 162).      14  See also Frahm, Sanherib p. 217. Note that there are at least eleven unfinished panels at Bavian.       15  The building report and the concluding formulae appear not to have been copied on the tablet. The same appears to be true with the inscription copied on K 2627 + K 2666 + K 2676 (+) ?  DT 320 (text nos. 140–141).       16  With regard to orthography, these later tablet copies regularly use the ÍA-sign, rather than the IA-sign, for the first person possessive suffix - ya ; the ŠÁ-sign, rather than the ŠA-sign, is almost exclusively used for the relative-determinative  ša ; and AN.ŠÁR, rather than ( d ) aš-šur , is regularly used to write the god Aššur’s name. As to phraseology, one notable slip is the use of the expression  ana bēlūt māti u nišē  (“for ruling over the land and people”), rather than the expected  ana rēʾût māti u nišē  (“for shepherding the land and people”), in the concluding formulae. For further information, see the commentaries and on-page notes to text nos. 135, 136–139, 140–141, and 161–162.       17  Text no. 7 may have been one of these. Ashurbanipal, rather than Esarhaddon, is suggested here as the king during whose reign the text was copied since Ashurbanipal is known to have rebuilt sections of the citadel wall; see Borger, BIWA pp. 118 Prism D viii 64–75 and p. 183 Prism E Stück 18 lines 4–8."

      "text": "Horizontal Stone Prisms     Stone Tablets     Stone Bull and Lion Colossi     Wall and Threshold Slabs     Stone Blocks (Including Horse Troughs) and Paving Stones          Bricks   Given the numerous building activities that Sennacherib sponsored at his administrative capital Nineveh, Assyria’s principal cult center Aššur, and other major Assyrian cities (including Kilīzu and Tarbiṣu), it is no surprise that nearly two hundred inscribed/stamped bricks of his are now found in museum collections around the world, especially in the British Museum (London) and Vorderasiatiches Museum (Berlin), or were copied or photographed by archaeologists shortly after their discovery in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. At present, fourteen different brick inscriptions are known from Nineveh (with duplicates found at other sites), thirteen from Aššur, three from Tarbiṣu, and one from Kilīzu. Bricks of his are also reported to have been discovered at Šibaniba (modern Tell Billa) and Tulul al-Lak (or Lak-teppeh), but nothing about their contents is known. The bricks vary in size and shape (usually square or rectangular, but occasionally well-head). Many of the bricks are inscribed by hand, either on the face or the edge; only a few bricks have inscriptions stamped on them. [18]  As one expects, the texts are short, ranging from two to six lines in length. The contents of the various different types are as follows: (1) only the Akkadian word  ekal  (“Palace”) followed by the king’s name and titles (text nos. 88–90); (2) Sennacherib’s name and titles, and a brief statement about the structure that he built anew or renovated (text nos. 91–100, 200–201, 215, and 219); (3) the king’s name and titles, the first person independent pronoun  anāku  (“I”), and a short statement about the building project (text nos. 196–199, 202, and 205); (4) a dedication to a deity, the king’s name and titles, and a brief statement about the building project (text nos. 195 and 216); and (5) the name of the structure for which the brick was intended and Sennacherib’s name and titles (text nos. 203–204). The texts are written in both the first and third persons; sometimes it is uncertain in which person the inscription is written owing to morphological ambiguity. At Nineveh, the bricks attest to Sennacherib’s work on his palace Egalzagdinutukua (text nos. 91–93), the inner and outer walls (text nos. 94–97) and a house for his son Aššur-šumu-ušabši (text nos. 98–100). [19]  At Aššur, the bricks attest to work on various sections of the Aššur temple Ešarra (text nos. 195–198), the Step Gate of the Old Palace (text nos. 199–202), sections of a royal mausoleum (text nos. 203–204), and a house for his son Aššur-nādin-šumi (text no. 205). The bricks from Tarbiṣu record that Sennacherib rebuilt the Nergal temple Egallammes there (text no. 216) and those from Kilīzu state that he constructed the walls of that city (text no. 219).        Horizontal Stone Prisms    In Assyria, horizontal stone prisms with royal inscriptions are not common. [20]  However, Sennacherib had at least one inscription (text no. 166) written on this type of object, which is a blend of the prism and cylinder formats: Each line of text is written along the long horizontal axis of the object and each of the eight horizontal faces is inscribed with five lines. In many regards, this object type has more in common with (barrel) cylinders than with prisms. With regard to content, the one known text written on this medium contains (1) Sennacherib’s titles and epithets, (2) an account of work on Ešarra, the Aššur temple at Aššur (in particular, work on the cella Eḫursaggalkurkurra, its  šuḫūru -house, and its new courtyard and gates), (3) an appeal to the building’s foundation to speak favorably to the god Aššur, and (4) advice to future rulers (concluding formulae). The format of the inscription is identical to that of four texts written on solid clay cylinders from Nineveh (text nos. 10–13).        Stone Tablets   In addition to smaller clay foundation deposits and inscribed bricks built into the superstructure of buildings and walls, Sennacherib’s scribes and craftsmen engraved texts on a variety of large stone objects, including foundation tablets. Only a handful of stone tablets are known for Sennacherib. In addition to five tablets from Nineveh (text nos. 34–37), four other stone tablets of this king are known: One from Aššur (text no. 168), two from Sūr-marrati (text no. 230), and one discovered at Takrit (text no. 231). Each tablet was inscribed with a single column of text on both the front and back. Like the Nineveh tablets intended for the armory, the texts written on the tablets intended for Sūr-marrati (probably modern Samarra) and the tablet discovered at Takrit contain both military and building narratives, whereas the stone tablet from Aššur includes only an account of construction (although the destruction of Babylon is mentioned in passing).    The Takrit tablet (text no. 231), of which only the first eleven and last six lines survive, is not sufficiently preserved for us to be certain of its contents and the date that it was inscribed. Because its prologue (the king’s titles, epithets, and commission by the god Aššur) and the beginning of the military narration are similar to text no. 34 (the so-called Nebi Yunus Inscription) and the end of the building report and the concluding formulae are similar to the text written on the tablets from Sūr-marrati (see below), it is possible that this tablet was also inscribed ca. 690–689 (Sennacherib’s 15th–16th regnal years).   One damaged stone tablet and one small fragment of a stone tablet from Sūr-marrati (text no. 230 ex. 1 = the Baltimore Inscription; text no. 230 ex. 2 = the Washington Inscription) appear to be inscribed with the same text. When compared to the other known texts on stone tablets, the inscription is a little unusual; this is perhaps due to the fact that it’s contents may have been more or less copied verbatim from a victory stele that was set up in the plain of Ḫalulê after the battle there (691). [21]  In the style of texts written on steles and rock reliefs (see below), the inscription begins with an invocation of gods, the king’s name and epithets, and a statement about the god Aššur supporting Sennacherib as his earthly representative, in particular during his campaigns to Chaldea and Elam. The military narration itself is unusual, not only in the manner in which the campaigns are recorded, but also in the number of campaigns it records. To conform with the numbering of the campaigns in the king’s annalistic narration on clay prisms, Sennacherib boasts of eight successful campaigns, with the centerpiece of the narrative (the battle of Ḫalulê) being the eighth. In the text, however, the king refers to only five events (his first, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth campaigns) and describes just three of them (his sixth, seventh, and eighth campaigns) in any detail. Before describing the battle of Ḫalulê, Sennacherib states that he campaigned against Chaldea four times and against Elam three times; no details are given about the individual campaigns. The inscription then goes on to narrate the events leading up to the battle of Ḫalulê, the battle itself and its aftermath, and the erecting of an inscribed victory stele on the field of battle. To provide some background information about why Sennacherib marched south against Mušēzib-Marduk, the king of Babylon, reports of the sixth and seventh campaigns are included, probably to elucidate why Sennacherib regarded the Elamite king Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu) “a rash fellow who does not have sense or insight”; those events are introduced by the formulae “on the first occasion” and “on the second occasion” respectively, and recorded in subordinate clauses, with the verbs marked by the subordinate marker - u . The building report, which follows the statement about setting up a victory stele, records that Sennacherib enlarged the city Sūr-marrati and built its wall. Unlike the other known stone tablets of Sennacherib, one tablet is dated. That exemplar was inscribed in the eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur (690), which is wrongly called in that text the “fourteenth year of Sennacherib”; this eponymy is actually the king’s 15th regnal year. [22]    The inscription on the stone tablet from Aššur (text no. 168) differs significantly in content from the two texts described above since it includes no military narration. This seventy-two line text contains (1) Sennacherib’s titles and epithets, (2) a detailed account of Sennacherib’s construction of the  akītu -house at Aššur, which was located just outside the western wall of that city, (3) an appeal to the building’s foundation to speak favorably to the god Aššur, and (4) advice to future rulers (concluding formulae). The building report is unusual since it mentions that people from Dilmun came and, under Sennacherib’s instructions, helped destroy Babylon; they removed earth from the city to pile up in the  akītu -house. A foreign ruler (Karib-il of Saba) is said to have provided an audience gift of (precious) stones and aromatics that were deposited in the foundation of the temple. The tablet is not dated, but since the sack and destruction of Babylon are explicitly mentioned, the inscription must date no earlier than 689.        Stone Bull and Lion Colossi   From 1847 to 1851, A.H. Layard uncovered by means of tunneling a portion (generally thought to be less than half) of Sennacherib’s large palace at Nineveh, exposing the walls and entrance ways of seventy rooms. [23]   Layard uncovered ca. 9,880 feet (= 3,011 m) of wall reliefs, the best preserved of which were transported back to the British Museum in London, as well as numerous pairs of stone bull ( aladlammu ) and lion ( apsasû ) colossi, objects inscribed with texts of the ruler whom he called the “Kouyunjik-king”; most of the colossi and sculpted slabs were badly cracked and scarred by heat when the palace was burnt during the sack of Nineveh in 612. After copying some of the better-preserved texts and removing some inscribed objects to be taken back to England, many sculptures were reburied.    In inscriptions written during the years 697–695 (the king’s 8th–10th regnal years), Sennacherib records that he had two alabaster bull colossi and seventy-two white limestone bull and lion colossi made and stationed in his palace’s gateways; this is in addition to numerous other stone and cast metal colossi that functioned as column bases. [24]  Although Layard mentions finding “twenty-seven portals, formed by colossal winged bulls and lion-sphinxes,” the details of only twenty-four pairs of colossi are recorded in Layard’s descriptions of his excavations of the South-West Palace. [25]   Nineteen pairs of these colossi are human-headed bull colossi, four pairs are lion colossi, and one pair is not described. In addition, L.W. King discovered remains of a few bull colossi during his 1903–4 excavations of the northeastern end of the palace (Sennacherib’s so-called Eastern Building); these were re-excavated by J.M. Russell in 1989–90 as part of D. Stronach’s Nineveh Project. Presumably, all of Sennacherib’s colossi were intended to be inscribed, but inscriptions on only twenty-three (or possibly twenty-five) bulls and four lions are known. Most are attested from Layard’s field copies (MS A, MS C, and MS D), but others were once attested by casts in the British Museum (objects that S. Smith had destroyed on the grounds that they had outlived their usefulness) or by originals (pieces that are either now in museum collections or whose in situ remains have been photographed).     The inscriptions on the known bull and lion colossi fall into three categories: (1) the first type (text nos. 39–40, 43, and 49–50) contains a short prologue, a building report describing the construction of Egalzagdinutukua (as well as the creation of a botanical garden, canals for irrigation, and a marsh), and a brief concluding statement; (2) the second type (text nos. 42 and 44–45, and possibly text nos. 41 and 47) has a short prologue, a summary of military campaigns, a building report describing the construction of Sennacherib’s new palace (as well as the creation of a botanical garden, canals for irrigation, and a marsh), and a brief concluding statement; [26]  and (3) the third type (text no. 46) contains a short prologue, annalistic narration of the king’s victories on the battlefield, a building report describing the construction of Sennacherib’s new palace (as well as the creation of a botanical garden, canals for irrigation, and a marsh), and a brief concluding statement. The division of the text falls into four types: (1) in the first (text no. 39), the inscription begins between one pair of legs of the colossus (the front or back), continues beneath the belly, and concludes between the other set of legs (the back or front); [27]  (2) in the second (text nos. 44 exs. 1 and 2, and possibly 45), the inscription begins between the hind legs and concludes under the belly; (3) in the third (text nos. 44 exs. 3 and 4, and possibly 41), the inscription begins under the belly and concludes between the hind legs; and (4) in the fourth (text nos. 40–43, 46, and probably 49–50), the inscription begins under the belly of the first colossus, continues between the hind legs of the that same colossus and then the hind legs of the second colossus, and concludes under the belly of the second colossus.    The dates that these bull and lion colossi were inscribed is less certain than one would hope. Based on comparisons with the contents of inscriptions written on octagonal clay prisms (text nos. 15–17) and the military narration included in some of those prism inscriptions, most of the bulls and lions, with the exception of the Eastern Building colossi, appear to have been inscribed from ca. 695 to late 694 or early 693, that is, at the time texts nos. 16–17 and 19–21, were being inscribed on prisms. [28]  Although the  terminus post quem   for text no. 42, which is on the bulls in Room I (the throne room), Door  d  and Door  e , is the fifth campaign (697; Sennacherib’s 8th regnal year), the same as text no. 16, the contents and wording of the building report and its placement in the palace suggest that that inscription was composed sometime between text nos. 16 and 17, in late 695 or at the very beginning of 694. Text no. 43 (which is on the bulls in Court H, Door  c  and Court VI, Door  a  and which does not contain any military narration) was written mid- to late 694 since its building report is identical (apart from two minor textual variants and orthographic variants) to that of text no. 42. [29]  A close look at the building reports of text no. 39 (which may have been written on the bulls in Court VI, Door  k ) and text no. 40 (which is inscribed on the lions in Court LXIV, Door  a , an entrance that was part of Tašmētu-šarrat’s, Sennacherib’s queen’s, living quarters) indicates that those two texts were composed earlier than text nos. 42 and 43, and later than text no. 16. [30]  Although text no. 40 has several lacunae, it appears that it was composed slightly later than text no. 39. Thus, text nos. 39 and 40 were probably composed ca. 696–695. It is possible that text no. 41 was also composed ca. 695, likely between text nos. 39–40 and 42–43, but too little of the inscription is preserved to be absolutely certain that this is the case. [31]   With regard to the dates of text no. 44 (which is written on the bulls lining the lower walls of the façade of Court H) and text no. 46 (which is on the bulls in Court H, Door  a ), the  terminus post quem   is the first part of the sixth campaign (late 694–early 693), the raid against the Bīt-Yakīn exiles living in Elam and, therefore, those inscriptions were composed shortly after that time. There is some evidence that text no. 44 was composed earlier than text no. 46. [32]   Too little of text nos. 45 and 47 is preserved to be able to propose a certain date of composition. Furthermore, nothing about the “nearly illegible” text no. 48, which is on the lions in Court XIX, Door  a , is known, so no date can be suggested. Although text nos. 49–50, which are written on bulls stationed in gateways of the northeastern end of the palace (Sennacherib’s Eastern Building), are very fragmentarily preserved, it is certain that these two inscriptions are the latest known bull inscriptions from the South-West Palace. These likely were composed between 693 and 691; the latter date is based on Sennacherib’s boast in text no. 22 (vi 36b–37), a copy of which is dated to 20-XII-691, that that palace had been completed. [33]      Some of the bulls are inscribed with short texts on the unsculpted surface that abutted the wall (the “back”). [34]   One of the bulls in Room I, Door  e  (text no. 42 ex. 1*), has the so-called Palace Inscription (text no. 80) on its wall-facing side. That text reads “Palace of Sennacherib, great king, king of the world, king of Assyria, the almighty sovereign of all rulers.” The back of at least one lion in Room XXXIII, Door  p , is inscribed with a short text (text no. 51) recording the discovery of  pendû -stone, a valuable and beautiful stone, at the foot of Mount Nipur (modern Judi Dagh), its sculpting into sphinxes ( apsasû ), and its transport to Nineveh.        Wall and Threshold Slabs    Sennacherib’s craftsmen changed the format for wall reliefs with accompanying texts that had been used by his predecessors. Bands of text that divided slabs into two registers were abandoned, thereby allowing images to be carved over the entire surface of the slabs; new spatial conventions, including a sense of depth, were adopted to accommodate the expanded pictorial area; and the only inscriptions visible were short epigraphs placed next to the image of the king, the king’s camp, or a city under siege. The additional space available on the sculpted slabs resulted in there being more space for accompanying text, thus allowing for epigraphs to be considerably longer than those of previous kings; the majority not only record the setting of the scene and action depicted, but also the identity of the king. Twenty-eight epigraphs are known from fifteen different rooms of Sennacherib’s Palace Without A Rival (text nos. 53–77); there must have been many more but, as A.H. Layard observed while clearing out the rooms, the upper portion of most of Sennacherib’s reliefs is now destroyed and that part of the slab was the usual location for this type of text. Most of the surviving epigraphs record events that took place during his first three campaigns, while only one records an event that took place in his fifth campaign. Several epigraphs record the procurement and transport of building materials and bull colossi. Several of the reliefs and accompanying texts describe events not recorded in other contemporary inscriptions; for example, the siege and capture of the Judean city of Lachish (text no. 66) and the siege of the city Alammu (text no. 59).     Numerous sculpted and unsculpted wall slabs from Sennacherib’s palace (including the so-called Eastern Building) and armory have inscribed on their wall-facing (“back”) surfaces a short proprietary text, the so-called Palace Inscription (text no. 80). It has been suggested this text was inscribed on most of the wall slabs (and colossi) decorating Sennacherib’s palace. [35]  Note that Sennacherib’s standard Palace Inscription is shorter than those written on the backs of slabs lining the rooms of the palaces of Ashurnasirpal II and Sargon II. Those inscriptions provide information about the king, his deeds, and the appearance of their magnificent royal residences, while this text of Sennacherib is a mere label that names the palace’s builder and owner.    Plain, unsculpted wall slabs inscribed with short texts of Sennacherib (text nos. 81–85) have been discovered in other parts of Nineveh, including the Šamaš Gate and the Ḫalzi Gate. These short inscriptions include Sennacherib’s name and titles, and a statement that he built anew the inner and outer walls of Nineveh and had them raised as high as mountains.    According A.H. Layard, “The pavement slabs were not inscribed as at Nimroud; but those between the winged bulls at some of the entrances [of Sennacherib’s palace], were carved with an elaborate and very elegant pattern.” [36]  Layard’s assessment, however, is not entirely correct. In fact, the stone floral threshold slabs of Room I, Doors  a  and  e  of the South-West Palace at Nineveh (text nos. 78–79) are inscribed with two-line texts stating that Sennacherib had had the “Palace Without a Rival” built at Nineveh. In addition to these two slabs, there may have been other decorated floral slabs in Sennacherib’s palace that were inscribed. Moreover, an inscribed threshold slab belonging to Sennacherib was discovered at Kilīzu (modern Qaṣr Šemāmok). That slab has written on it a six-line text (text no. 218) that contains Sennacherib’s name, titles, and a statement that he built anew the inner and outer walls of that city and had them raised as high as mountains.         Stone Blocks (Including Horse Troughs) and Paving Stones   At Aššur, Sennacherib used large stone blocks (text nos. 169–189) not only for the foundation of the Zababa temple (text no. 177), the Step Gate of the Old Palace (text no. 178), a house for his son Aššur-ilī-muballissu (formerly read Aššur-ilī-bulliṭsu; text nos. 179–185), and sections of the Aššur temple (text nos. 169–170), but also for the structure of the  akītu -house and as paving stones for its processional way (text nos. 171–176). [37]  As on bricks, the texts on stone blocks are relatively short, with their inscriptions ranging from three to ten lines in length. The style of the texts’ contents is all the same: They begin with the king’s name, titles, and epithets, and conclude with a brief statement about the work, including a reference to the use of stone in the project. Unlike the known brick inscriptions of Sennacherib, which can be written in either the first or third person, all of his known block inscriptions appear to be written in the first person. The first person independent pronoun  anāku  (“I”), when included, appears either at the beginning of the inscription or after the king’s titles and epithets. An individual text can be written on a single block of stone (text nos. 169–173 and 177–189) or carved across a series of six to nine blocks (text nos. 174–176).     Inscribed stone blocks were also used to line the walls and floors of canals that were intended to convey a regular and abundant supply of water towards important Assyrian cities, especially Nineveh. Numerous such blocks were discovered at Jerwan by T. Jacobsen and S. Lloyd in 1932–33. The inscriptions on these blocks (text nos. 224–228) range from short, two-line labels (text nos. 224–225) — comprising the Akkadian word  ekal  (“Palace”) followed by the king’s name and titles — written on a single block and medium length texts written on a series of blocks recording that Sennacherib had canals dug and lined with stone blocks (text nos. 226–227), to lengthy texts (text no. 228) that are written on numerous stone blocks and that include military narration. Unfortunately, with regard to the longest text from Jerwan, little can be said with certainty about its contents since the 202 stone blocks inscribed with it were discovered in secondary usage, with the original arrangement of the blocks being completely abandoned. The inscribed blocks were found scattered haphazardly among uninscribed blocks; in some cases the inscription had been turned sideways, in others upside down, and in numerous cases the blocks were re-cut, further damaging the top and bottom lines of those blocks. Based on what can be gleaned from the fragmentary remains of the jigsaw puzzle of an inscription, the text apparently included a prologue, reports of at least two campaigns (Sennacherib’s first and second campaigns), and a building report. The inscription, when complete, may have been written in at least three columns, with a minimum height of nine courses of blocks per column (with two to three lines per block) and approximately sixteen to twenty-one signs per line (each line stretching over seven blocks). Therefore, each column contained at least twenty-six lines of text, making the inscription at least seventy-eight lines long. A precise date for the inscription cannot be determined, but it is generally thought that Sennacherib’s work in the Jerwan area was undertaken between 694 and 689 and, thus, the inscriptions were probably composed during that time. Moreover, several blocks forming the entrance to a tunnel near Arbela, a major cult center of the goddess Ištar, are inscribed with a short eight-line inscription (text no. 229) stating that Sennacherib had three canals dug to bring water to Arbela; the style of the text is similar to text nos. 226–227.     Just north of Nebi Yunus, several series of stone blocks with a channel running down the length of their tops were discovered; based on the inscription written on them (text no. 132) and the presence of the channel, these blocks were probably used as horse troughs. Each set comprised three blocks and was inscribed with the same short text stating that Sennacherib made these troughs and paved the area around them with pieces of different types of stone, unused material from other building projects at Nineveh.    At Babylon, several paving stones of breccia inscribed with “Sennacherib, king of Assyria” (text no. 232) were discovered by R. Koldewey in July 1900; the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II reused and reinscribed them. Because these stones were used as paving stones by Nebuchadnezzar, it is assumed that Sennacherib also used them as paving stones for the processional way at Babylon. The objects were probably inscribed during his first reign over Babylonia (704–703) or when his vassal Bēl-ibni or his son Aššur-nādin-šumi sat on the throne of Babylon (702–694).        Notes        18  The inscription on HMA 9-1764 (text no. 92 ex. 11) is reported to have been stamped; see Foxvog, RA 72 (1978) p. 43. The authors have not been able to confirm that the brick’s text is stamped rather than inscribed.      19  Note that bricks inscribed with duplicates of these inscriptions have been discovered at Aššur, Beisan, Kilīzu, and Tell Yarah.      20  The shape of these stone horizontal prisms is similar to that of the clay prismatic cylinders of Sargon II from Dūr-Šarrukīn, Kalḫu, Nineveh, Tell Haddad, and Tell Baradān; these prism-like cylinders have 8–10 faces. However, with regard to content, the two mediums are quite different. Sennacherib’s stone horizontal prisms are inscribed with inscriptions describing only building activities, while Sargon’s clay prismatic cylinders are inscribed with texts commemorating achievements both on and off the battlefield, much like most of Sennacherib’s clay cylinders from Nineveh (with exemplars found at Aššur) and Tarbiṣu. For further information and a catalogue of Sargon’s prism-like cylinders, see Frame, Studies Parpola pp. 80–82 (Addendum 2).      21  A.K. Grayson (AfO 20 [1963] p. 87) proposes that a letter to a god could have been a likely source for some of the contents of this text; this proposal, however, cannot be presently supported by the extant Sennacherib corpus. For further information about the unusual style of the inscription, see ibid. pp. 83–89.      22  According to this text, the year 703 would be Sennacherib’s first regnal year. It has been suggested that this discrepancy arose because the Assyrians were not accustomed to dating texts by regnal year (that is, in a Babylonian fashion) or because Assyrian scribes did not always achieve precision when calculating dates according to varying calendrical systems. On “double datings,” see Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 70–71.      23  H. Rassam (1852–54, 1878–82), W. Loftus (1854–55), G. Smith (1873–74), E.A.W. Budge (1889–91), L.W. King (1903–4), R.C. Thompson (1904–5), T.A. Madhloom (1965–71), and D. Stronach and J.M. Russell (1989–90) also carried out excavations on the South-West Palace, including its northeastern section (Sennacherib’s Eastern Building, which is sometimes erroneously called the  bīt nakkapti ). In 1965–71, the Iraq Department of Antiquities and Heritage, under the direction of Madhloom, re-excavated Sennacherib’s throne room suite (Rooms I–V, Court H, and Court VI), unearthing the fragmentary remains of numerous sculpted and inscribed orthostats and bull colossi; that area has now been converted into a site museum, with ca. 100 reliefs displayed in their original positions. For details about the throne room suite and a catalogue of its sculpture, see J.M. Russell, Final Sack.      24  Text no. 15 vi 61–vii 4 and text no. 16 vi 74–vii 11. In 702, Sennacherib boasts that he created for his palace eight bronze lion colossi and an unspecified number of bull colossi made of silver, bronze, and mountain stone. From 697 to early to mid-695, he records that the palace contained twelve copper lion colossi, ten sphinxes of  urudû -copper, ten sphinxes of alabaster, twelve sphinxes of GU.AN.NA-metal, twelve bull colossi of  urudû -copper, two bull colossi of alabaster, and seventy-two bull and lion colossi of white limestone. From mid- to late 695 to early 693, Sennacherib states that there were in his palace, as column bases and gateway guardians, an unspecified number of bull colossi of copper, alabaster, and white limestone, an unspecified number of sphinxes of alabaster,  urudû -copper, and GU.AN.NA-metal, twelve lion colossi of copper, and twenty-two sphinxes of copper.       25  Layard, Discoveries p. 589. On his plan of the palace (ibid., between pp. 67 and 68), Layard records finding nineteen pairs of colossi, while one of his accounts of the excavation (ibid. p. 645) mentions five additional pairs in the west entrance; note that three of these five pairs appear to have been restored on the plan of the South-West Palace. Furthermore, six more pairs have also been restored on the plan. There is a discrepancy in the various totals stated by Layard.        26  Despite the very fragmentary nature of all four exemplars of text no. 44, the colossi lining the lower walls of the façade of Court H, these four bulls all preserve parts of one and the same inscription. See the commentary of that text and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 265–270.        27  A.H. Layard’s numbering of the inscribed surfaces in MS D fols. 24–29 suggests that text no. 39 was inscribed on a pair of five-legged colossi, a sculpture type not recorded by the excavators of the South-West Palace. As pointed out by J.M. Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 279), this does not rule out the possibility that such colossi were erected in Sennacherib’s royal residence at Nineveh. Four-legged bulls appear to have been the norm for colossi during Sennacherib’s reign; five-legged bulls were used exclusively during the reigns of his predecessors (Ashurnasirpal II, Shalmaneser III, and Sargon II). In the case of text no. 39 ex. 1, the inscription began between the front legs, continued beneath the belly, and concluded between the back legs, whereas with ex. 2, the inscription began between the back legs, continued beneath the belly, and concluded between the front legs.        28  At present, there are no known prism inscriptions that were written between text no. 16 (latest dated exemplar copied on 3-V-695) and text no. 17 (both dated copies inscribed in V-694) and no complete prism inscriptions for the year 693 (Sennacherib’s 12th regnal year); text no. 20 (and possibly text no. 21) was written on a prism in 693, but only a small portion of its military narration is preserved.        29  Text no. 43 line 16 records that Sennacherib converted a 554×289 cubit area into dry land before building a 190-layer brick terrace on top of it, while text no. 42 line 23 records that same area as being 360×289 cubits in size. The final dimensions of the palace in text no. 43 lines 19b–20a are 914×440 large cubits, while they are either 7[00×440] or 9[14×440] large cubits in text no. 42 line 27; Layard’s copy in MS A has 7 [ME], but his copy in ICC has 9 [ME 14]. Because Layard’s draft copies are usually more accurate than his published typeset ones and because the area of dry land converted to terrace in MS A is identical to that in earlier inscriptions written on bull colossi (text no. 39), the dimensions of the palace recorded in text no. 42 are probably 7[00×440] cubits. Thus, based on these two variants, text no. 42 appears to be earlier than text no. 43. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 123) dates text no. 42 and text no. 43 ex. 1 to ca. 696.      30 The provenance of text no. 39 is conjectural since there is no information on the colossi that were inscribed with this text. For the proposed provenance, which is based on A.H. Layard’s statement that the inscription was “nearly entire” (Discoveries p. 71), see J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 279–280.       31  For details on the proposed date, see the commentary to that text.       32  See the commentary and on-page notes to text no. 44.      33  Based on parallels between this text and text no. 34 (lines 72–74a) in their description of  pendû -stone, E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 122) proposes that the inscriptions on the Eastern Building bulls were probably composed after 690.       34  It is not impossible that most, if not all, of Sennacherib’s colossi bore short texts on their unsculpted, wall-facing surfaces. For this opinion, see also J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 127.      35  J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 127.      36  Layard, Discoveries p. 652. For a drawing of one of these floral threshold slabs, see J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 133 fig. 41.      37  Text nos. 186–189 are not sufficiently preserved to accurately determine what building activity their inscriptions commemorate."

      "text": "Stone Vessels     Small Stone Objects, including Stone Beads and Cylinders     Steles and Rock Reliefs     Metal Objects         Stone door sockets   A few inscribed door sockets from Nineveh and Aššur are known. Three are certainly from the South-West Palace at Nineveh (text no. 86 exs. 1–3) and three from the Aššur temple at Aššur (text no. 190 and text no. 191 exs. 1–2), while the provenances of another three are unknown (text no. 87 exs. 1–3). The door sockets from Sennacherib’s palace record the king’s name and titles, and state that Sennacherib had had  kašurû -stone (a type of basalt) brought back to Nineveh and made into door sockets. The door sockets from the Aššur temple at Aššur (text no. 190 and text no. 191 exs. 1–2) begin with a short dedication to Aššur, which includes the god’s name and epithets, and then continues with the king’s name and titles and a statement about constructing gateways and making door sockets from  kašurû -stone. These inscribed door sockets were presumably intended for the gates that Sennacherib claims to have had built while working on Ešarra (see below for details) and, therefore, were probably commissioned sometime after 689; text no. 191 ex. 2 certainly came from the “Gate of the Wagon Star” and text no. 191 ex. 1 may have come from the “Gate of the Firmament.” The inscriptions on the remaining three door sockets (text no. 87 exs. 1–3), those objects whose provenance is not known, include only the king’s name and titles. It is assumed that these door sockets come from one of the many cities in which Sennacherib commissioned large-scale building projects, such as Nineveh and Aššur.      Stone Water Basin   Fragments of a large and elaborately carved stone water basin found at Aššur preserve part of one or two inscriptions of Sennacherib (text no. 192). Two of the four sides were inscribed, but since only a small portion of the inscribed surface on each of those sides is preserved, it is not possible to determine if this basin was inscribed twice with the same text or if it had two different inscriptions on it. Apart from the king’s name, his titles “king of the world” and “king of Assyria,” and his epithet claiming to have fashioned the images of deities ( ēpiš ṣalam  …  “the one who fashioned the image(s) of …”), nothing else is certain about the inscription(s).        Stone Vessels   Two stone vessels — a  naḫbuṣu -vessel (text no. 133) and a  kappu -vessel (text no. 134) — are inscribed with three-line texts recording that Sennacherib had given them as gifts to his son Aššur-ilī-muballissu. The inscriptions, written in Assyrian, contain the king’s name and the title “king of Assyria,” a statement that the objects were given to his son, and a curse upon anyone who removed them from his possession.      Small Stone Objects, including Stone Beads and Cylinders   Thirty-two cylinder-shaped beads are inscribed with short proprietary inscriptions of Sennacherib; the beads vary in size, shape, and stone. [38]  Some of these were given to him by foreign rulers as part of their audience gifts, while others were taken as booty. [39]  On a few occasions, the king states that he had the beads inscribed in his presence. The contents of the inscriptions themselves fall into six groups: (1) the Akkadian word  ekal  (“Palace of”) followed by the king’s name, titles, and curses (text nos. 120–124); (2)  ekal  followed by the king’s name, titles, and a statement that the object was given as a gift, with the name of the foreign ruler who gave the gift recorded (text nos. 102); (3)  ekal  followed by the king’s name, titles, a statement that the object was given as a gift, with the name of the ruler who gave the bead recorded, and curses (text nos. 103–110); (4)  ekal  followed by the king’s name, titles, curses, and a statement that the object was taken as booty (text nos. 111–112); (5)  ekal  followed by the king’s name, titles, a statement that the object was taken as booty, and curses (text nos. 113–116); and (6)  ekal  followed by the king’s name, titles, the name of the stone (and its place of origin), and curses (text nos. 117–119, 127 ? , 210). [40]  The gods named in the curse formulae vary from bead to bead, but Aššur is always named; the gods are called upon to make the name and seed of anyone who alters the bead disappear from the land. [41]  The function and purpose of these beads are not immediately obvious, but they may have formed part of a foundation deposit, as suggested by an inscription written on a stone tablet describing the rebuilding of the  akītu -house at Aššur (text no. 168). The relevant passage (lines 48b–55a) reads:    While laying the foundation of the  akītu -house, [I] brought forth the audience gift of Karib-il, king of the land Saba —  pappardilû -stone, choice stones, (and) fine aromatics — and from that audience gift I laid stones (and) aromatics in its foundation. Like ..., I …  silver, gold, carnelian, lapis lazuli,  ḫulālu -stone,  muššaru -stone,  pappardilû -stone,  papparmīnu -stone,  dāmātu -paste, (and) all of the finest aromatics in the foundation of that  akītu -house. I sprinkled that foundation with perfumed oil (and) fine oil as  (abundantly as) river water.   These beads may have been regarded as having magical power that drove away evil and were thus deposited in the foundations to protect the building. Some of these beads may well have been intended for the foundations of Aššur’s  akītu -house. If this proves correct, then they would have been inscribed sometime after 689.   Sennacherib’s seal (text no. 212) is known only from impressions on several copies of Esarhaddon’s Succession Treaty (often referred to as the Vassal Treaty of Esarhaddon) from Kalḫu and Tell Taʿyinat; the Aššur fragments of the Succession Treaty do not preserve the seal impression. The actual seal itself has been lost, is in a private collection, or remains buried in Iraq. The seal’s sixteen-line text states that it was “The Seal of Destinies ( kunuk šīmāti ) [by which] (the god) Aššur, king of the gods, seals (the destinies of) the Igīgū and Anunnakū gods, the heavens, the netherworld, and man[kind].” The text then contains curses against altering the seal and removing the king’s name from it. Sennacherib added his name to a second seal: A lapis-lazuli seal of the Babylonian king Šagarakti-Šuriaš. That seal is no longer extant (or is hidden away in some private collection), but the contents of the three inscriptions written on it are known from a copy (text no. 156) that was made during the reign of Sennacherib or one of his successors (Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal). The seal originally belonged to Šagarakti-Šuriaš, was taken as booty from Babylon during the reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I, returned to Babylon as a gift (at an unspecified time), and again taken as booty by Sennacherib when he captured and destroyed Babylon in 689. [42]  Tukultī-Ninurta added onto the seal a short curse against anyone who would remove his name. The texts of Tukultī-Ninurta and Sennacherib on this seal are both written in Assyrian.    Finally, a small lion finial is inscribed with a short text recording that Sennacherib gave it to his son Esarhaddon (text no. 233). The object, which is reported to have come from Sippar (but is more likely to have been found at Nineveh), was probably inscribed ca. 683–681 since Esarhaddon appears to be referred to as “senior-ranking son.”       Steles and Rock Reliefs   In addition to erecting round-topped steles (each with an image of the king and symbols of various gods and goddesses) on both sides of the royal road at Nineveh (text no. 38), Sennacherib boasts of having a victory stele erected outside the city Bīt-Kilamzaḫ after his second campaign (702), another outside the city Illubru (in Ḫilakku [Cilicia]) after one of his officials led a campaign there in the king’s 9th regnal year (696), and a third near the city Ḫalulê after the battle there during his fourteenth regnal regal (691). [43]  Although those steles are no longer extant, their shape and contents can be inferred from other Assyrian stele and rock reliefs, as well as from an inscription written on two stone tablets (text no. 230). Many extant Assyrian steles have a rounded top with an image of the king standing before symbols of his tutelary deities and these too may have had this shape and imagery. As to the contents of the inscriptions, the texts probably contained: (1) an invocation of gods; (2) the king’s name, titles, and epithets; (3) a statement about the god Aššur providing support to the Assyrian king; (4) military narration, with a lengthy description of the event that the stele commemorates; (5) a short report stating that the king had a stele erected; and (6) concluding formulae (with curses against anyone who removes, alters, or damages the stele). Two stone tablets from the city Sūr-marrati (text no. 230) may have been more or less copied verbatim from a victory stele that was set up in the plain of Ḫalulê after the battle there; for further details on the contents, see the discussion of text no. 230. If this assumption is correct, then the contents of at least one victory stele of Sennacherib is known, even though the original stele is now lost.   A fragment from the upper portion of a round-topped stele found at Aššur (text no. 167) preserves the beginning of an inscription of Sennacherib. The contents of the extant text duplicate (with some variation) text no. 168, which is written on a stone tablet and commemorates the construction of the  akītu -house at Aššur. The rest of the stele text may have more or less duplicated the tablet inscription. Thus, the contents of the stele would have been similar to that of the steles that Sennacherib erected in Nineveh.    Like his grandfather Tiglath-pileser III and his father Sargon II, Sennacherib not only had victory steles set up outside the gates of conquered cities but also had round-topped, stele-like niches carved into the sides of rock cliffs. Like the steles they imitate in shape, the stele-like niches have carved in them an image of the king standing before symbols of several deities; the ruler, who faces either to the left or right, has one hand raised in a gesture of supplication and/or adoration while holding an object (frequently a mace) in the other hand. The space to the left and right of the king, and sometimes the clothing of the king, is inscribed. The content of the inscriptions on these “victory steles” carved into the sides of cliffs is generally similar to that of texts found on victory steles themselves. They contain: (1) an invocation of gods; (2) the king’s name, titles, and epithets, with a brief statement of divine support; (3) military narration, with a lengthy description of the event that the monument commemorates; (4) a short report stating that the king had a monument or monuments made and inscribed; and (5) concluding formulae. During his fifth campaign (697), Sennacherib had several such inscribed reliefs carved at Judi Dagh in southern Turkey to commemorate his victories over the insubmissive inhabitants of cities located on and near Mount Nipur (text no. 222). Altogether, Sennacherib had at least eight sculpted panels carved at Judi Dagh; six are near the village Shakh and two are near the village Hasanah. Six of those panels were completed, while the other two were only prepared for engraving. Although the monuments are all badly weathered and difficult to decipher, the inscriptions themselves largely duplicate one another; there are variations in the military narration, but the extent of the deviation is not clear given their state of preservation.    At Bavian, near the village of Khinnis, Sennacherib also had numerous round-topped, stele-like niches carved into the sides of rock cliffs. Eleven small panels with images of the king standing before symbols of his divine patrons are known, but only three are inscribed. All three have the same inscription (text no. 223), but the contents are slightly different to those of the inscriptions at Judi Dagh (text no. 222). This is not surprising as the former monuments were carved in Assyria proper and were primarily intended to commemorate the creation of an extensive canal system that brought water to Nineveh and its vicinity. The Bavian inscriptions contain: (1) an invocation of gods; (2) the king’s name, titles, epithets, and a brief statement of divine support; (3) a statement about the lack of water in the vicinity of Nineveh during the reigns of his predecessors; (4) a detailed account of the creation of a complex canal system, comprising eighteen canals, including the Patti-Sennacherib and Nār-Sennacherib canals; (5) military narration, which comprises only descriptions of the battle of Ḫalulê (691) and the conquest and destruction of Babylon (689); (6) a short report stating that the king had six monuments made; and (7) concluding formulae. The  terminus post quem   is the conquest of Babylon in late 689 and, therefore, the inscription was likely written ca. 688.           Metal Objects    Very few metal objects from the reigns of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal survive today. A small bronze weight (0.241 kg) in the shape of a crouching lion is inscribed with Sennacherib’s name and a note in Akkadian and Aramaic that the object weighed one half  mina  (text no. 211). The lion was one of sixteen bronze weights that A.H. Layard discovered in 1846 under one of the colossal winged bulls flanking Entrance b of the throne room (Chamber B) of the North-West Palace at Kalḫu (Nimrud). Thirteen are inscribed with Akkadian (and Aramaic) inscriptions and one of these belongs to Sennacherib; the other weights date to the reigns of Tiglath-pileser III, Shalmaneser V, and Sargon II.     Two fragments of bronze plating with texts of Sennacherib are also known (text nos. 193–194). Based on their contents, both pieces are presumably from Aššur. The first inscription (text no. 193) appears to be part of the bronze plating of an object dedicated to the god Aššur. The damaged fifteen-line text comprises a short dedication to Aššur that includes: The god’s name and epithets; Sennacherib’s name, titles, and epithets; and a building report that commemorates the fashioning of the bronze plating, which was cast through the craft of the deity Ninagal. The association of the piece with the Aššur temple at Aššur is based on the fact that the “Dais of Destinies” and the “path of the god Aššur” are mentioned in the text. Very little is preserved of the second inscription (text no. 194). What is extant duplicates with some deviation the text written on horizontal stone prisms (text no. 166); how much of the rest of the inscription duplicated text no. 166 is not known. Both objects were probably commissioned around the time that he was working on the Aššur temple (after 689).         Notes       38  Two inscriptions that were to be written on cylinder-shaped beads are known from a tablet containing drafts of those texts (text no. 157). These texts, which are similar in style to text nos. 117–119 and 211, state that beads came from the otherwise unattested city Gala... (name damaged). For a more detailed study of these beads and those of other Assyrian rulers, see Frahm, CRRA 42 pp. 79–99; and Galter, ARRIM 5 (1987) pp. 11–30.      39  The following rulers are known to have given Sennacherib cylinder-shaped beads as part of their audience gifts: Abī-Baʾal of Samsimuruna (text no. 102), Karib-il of Saba (text nos. 103–108), and Nabû-zēr-kitti-līšir (text no. 109). The name of the ruler in text no. 110 is not preserved. Karib-il’s contributions are also recorded on a stone tablet commemorating the construction of the  akītu -house at Aššur; see text no. 168 lines 48b–55a. Beads were taken as booty from Dumetu (text nos. 111–114) and Duma (text no. 115), both of which are probably identical with the Arabian city Adummatu, which Sennacherib captured ca. 690.      40  The bead inscribed with text no. 117 is reported to have been made of  ḫulālu -stone, the one with text no. 119 of  papparmīnu - or  pappardilû -stone, and the cylinder-shaped bead with text no. 210 of  papparmīnu -stone.      41  Adad, Anu, Aššur, Bēl, Ištar, Nabû, Nergal, Sîn, Šamaš, and Uraš are invoked in the curse formulae on these beads.      42  On one side of K 2673 (text no. 156), the scribe copied the inscriptions of Šagarakti-Šuriaš and Tukultī-Ninurta I, while on the other face he copied the inscriptions of both of those kings along with Sennacherib’s own.      43  See, for example, text no. 3 line 26, text no. 17 iv 90–91, and text no. 230 lines 113–114. For a study of Neo-Assyrian steles, in particular those of Sargon II, see Frame, Subartu 18 (2006) pp. 49–68."

      "text": "Most of Sennacherib’s building activities at Nineveh were discussed in Part 1 (pp. 16–22), so only a few projects will be described here. The building reports included in texts inscribed on stone bull ( aladlammû ) and lion ( apsasû ) colossi and clay tablets more or less duplicate the building reports known from clay cylinders and prisms. [45]      Royal Palaces and Houses      In addition to building the “Palace Without a Rival,” Sennacherib appears to have had a second palace constructed on the citadel of Nineveh, in the northeastern quadrant, north of the temples. No contemporary inscriptions of Sennacherib record the building of this palace, but at least two texts of his grandson Ashurbanipal written on clay prisms state that Sennacherib built the “House of Succession” ( bīt ridûti ), a royal residence that Ashurbanipal completely rebuilt to be his own palace. That building is often referred to as the North Palace as it is located on the northern part of Kuyunjik. [46]  The nature and extent of Sennacherib’s work on this palace and the dates it was carried out are unknown and, therefore, no further details can be provided here.    Numerous bricks attest to Sennacherib building a house for his son Aššur-šumu-ušabši (text nos. 98–100); this building is located in Area SH (“Sennacherib’s House”), which is near the city wall, about 500 m north of Kuyunjik. [47]  Bricks (text no. 101) discovered in a palatial building excavated about 600 m northeast of Nebi Yunus attest to another project of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Since those inscriptions have not yet been published, we do not know the function of that building.        Notes      45  Inscriptions on stone bull and lion colossi, sculpted wall slabs, decorated threshold slabs, door sockets, bricks, and clay tablets refer to work on Sennacherib’s palace, including a wing for his wife Tašmētu-šarrat.

An inscription on a fragment of a clay tablet (text no. 151 rev. i 1'–13') preserves part of a passage describing the construction of Nineveh’s walls and gates. Stone slabs and bricks attest to Sennacherib’s work on Nineveh’s main (or great) inner wall, Badnigalbilukurašušu (“Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies”), and outer stone wall, Badnigerimḫuluḫa (“Wall, Terrorizer of Enemies”); see text nos. 81–84 and 94–97. A small tablet (either an archival copy or a draft) is inscribed with a short, monumental inscription recording work on the armory (text no. 152 obv. 4b–17). Copies of inscriptions on fragments of clay tablets preserve reports on the rebuilding of the citadel wall, the construction of bridges and aqueducts, the creation of botanical gardens and marshes, and the widening of the city’s squares and streets; see text no. 136 rev. i' 1'–16', text no. 138 rev. ii' 17–36, and text no. 151 obv. i' 1–12.      46  Borger, BIWA p. 72 Prism F vi 22–25 and Prism A x 51–54. Less than half of the North Palace has been excavated; this is in part due to the fact that the level of the floor is not far below the surface of the mound and in part due to the fact that much of the building has been destroyed by erosion and numerous post-Assyrian occupations. The “House of Succession,” which was presumably smaller that the one built by Ashurbanipal, may have originally been northwest of the Ištar temple Emašmaš. For further information on that palace, see Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) pp. 416–418 §§14.4 and 14.7.       47  For further information, see Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) p. 420 §15.4."

      "text": "The Akītu-House          Like Nineveh, Aššur (mod. Qalʿat Širqāt),  [48]  Assyria’s traditional religious capital, received a great deal of attention from Sennacherib. The construction of a new  akītu -house outside the western city wall and the reorientation and reconstruction of the central sanctuary and main courtyard of the Aššur temple Ešarra were the two most important projects, both of which took place after the destruction of Babylon in 689. A new processional way was constructed to link the two buildings. Sennacherib renovated sections of the Old Palace (including the Step Gate) and possibly also the Sîn-Šamaš temple and the city wall, as well as its gates. In addition, he built houses for at least two of his sons, a temple (or sanctuary) for the god Zababa, and a royal tomb. The remains of those buildings, as well as bricks and stone blocks discovered during the 1903–14 German excavations led by W. Andrae, provide evidence for Sennacherib’s building activities at Aššur.       The Aššur Temple   After sacking and destroying Babylon in late 689 (Sennacherib’s 16th regnal year), Sennacherib remodeled and rebuilt the central sanctuary of the Aššur temple Ešarra (“House of the Universe”), together with its cella (Eḫursaggalkurkurra; “House of the Great Mountain of the Lands”) and  šuḫūru -house (Eḫursaggula; “House, Big Mountain”), in an attempt to replicate the Esagil complex at Babylon. Sennacherib had a new, multi-room complex, the so-called “Ostanbau,” added onto the existing structure. [49]  A new entrance to the main cult rooms was built. [50]  The king states that the proper orientation of the entrance to Aššur’s cella (Rooms o+p) had been disregarded by his predecessors so he created a new entrance. The old south-facing entrance was replaced by a new east-facing entrance, which he named the “Royal Gate” ( bāb šarrūti ). [51]   Along with the changes made to that temple, which the king states were divinely approved through extispicy, Sennacherib had a new  akītu -house constructed outside the western wall of the city; moreover, he instituted numerous theological reforms. [52]     In connection with the reorientation of the principal entrance to Aššur’s cella, Sennacherib rebuilt the  bīt-šuḫūri  (possibly Room q) and widened and decorated its gate, which he named the “Gate of the Path of the Enlil-Stars” ( bāb ḫarrān šūt Enlil ). That ornately decorated gate — which had metal statues of four bull-shaped son-of-Šamaš figures as well as a fish-man, a bronze carp-man, a lion-man, and a scorpion-man — probably provided the  bīt-šuḫūri  access to a large courtyard (the courtyard of the “Ostanbau”). [53]  Sennacherib constructed a new paved courtyard, which he called the “Courtyard of the Row of Pedestals for the Igīgū Gods” ( kisal sidir manzāz Igīgī ). [54]  Inner and outer gates were placed in the southeast, northeast, and southwest walls; the northwest wall, which formed part of the existing structure of the temple, also had inner and outer gates (the “Royal Gate” and the “Gate of the Path of the Enlil-Stars”). The inner and outer gates in the southeast wall (those facing east, towards the Tigris River) were probably the “Gate of the Entrance of the Igīgū Gods” ( bāb nēreb Igīgī ) and the “Gate of the Firmament” ( bāb burūmē ); those in the southwest wall (those facing south) were likely the “Gate of the Abundance of the Land” ( bāb ḫiṣib māti ) and the “Kamsū-Igīgū Gate” ( bāb kamsū Igīgī ); and those in the northeast wall (those facing north) were probably the “Gate of the Dais of Destinies” ( bāb parak šīmāte ) and the “Gate of the Wagon Star“ ( bāb ereqqi ). [55]  Doors of cedar were hung in these gateways; their door posts rested upon door sockets made from  kašurrû -stone (a type of basalt). In the southwest corner of the newly-built courtyard, Sennacherib placed a large, elaborately sculpted stone water basin; a well was dug nearby. Sennacherib states that he also had a portable bronze brazier installed in this courtyard.   The forecourt, as indicated by archaeological evidence, was raised and repaved; bricks of his father Sargon II were reused in this project.     Two pieces of metal plating attest to Sennacherib having objects that were plated with bronze in the temple. One of the pieces may have adorned the Dais of Destinies ( parak šīmāte ); in addition to being inscribed, that bronze plating may have also depicted the Tablet of Destinies, the god Aššur, and Sennacherib (text no. 193). [56]  A tablet copy of a dedicatory inscription (text no. 159) attests to the king having a kettledrum made for the god Aššur; this text would have been written on the metal plating of the drum. There were presumably other objects made for Assyria’s principal deity at this time, but the written and archaeological evidence for this are lacking. It is known from two tablets inscribed during the reign of Ashurbanipal that Sennacherib dedicated Marduk’s bed and throne to Aššur after he had had them removed from the Esagil temple at Babylon; Sennacherib had dedicatory inscriptions written on the metal plating of those objects (text nos. 161–162).  [57]         The  Akītu- House   As part of his post-689 reforms, Sennacherib had a new  akītu -house constructed outside the western wall of the city in an attempt to replicate the cultic topography of Babylon. [58]  An inscription written on a stone tablet suggests that the original New Year’s temple had been situated outside the city, but had long been forgotten and that the  akītu -ceremonies were being performed inside Aššur. The structure of the  akītu -house of the steppe, whose Sumerian ceremonial name is Eabbaugga (“House Where Tiāmat Is Put To Death”), was built entirely from (inscribed) stone blocks. [59]  The planning of the temple proved difficult: The original ground plan was abandoned and replaced by a newer one with a moderately different plan. [60]  The people of Dilmun are reported to have taken part in the destruction of Babylon and to have helped Sennacherib place dirt from that city in the Assyrian  akītu -house. Karib-il, the king of Saba, gave Sennacherib a substantial audience gift consisting of metal, small stone cylinder-shaped beads, and aromatics that were to be deposited in the foundations of the  akītu -house. The temple itself was surrounded by lush, well-irrigated gardens and fruit orchards; the species of plants and trees are not known. In the main entrance of the temple, Sennacherib had an ornate bronze door cast using a new bronze casting technique. That elaborate work of art depicted an epic battle, representing a scene from the Assyrian version of  Enūma eliš . [61]  Aššur was shown raising his bow and riding in a chariot with the god Amurru. At least twenty-five other gods and goddesses are depicted with him, some on foot and some in chariots.     In connection with the construction of that temple, Sennacherib may have created and/or renovated images/statues of the various gods and goddesses who participated in the  akītu -festival. This work is not recorded in extant texts, but the king regularly calls himself “the one who fashioned the image(s)” ( ēpiš ṣalam ) of various gods. Although the epithet could refer to the images of the deities depicted on the bronze gate of the  akītu -house, it could also refer to images/statues of deities participating in the  akītu -festival. [62]  Finally, in order to connect the new  akītu -house to the renovated Aššur temple, a new stone processional way between them was constructed.

The work appears to have been carried out in two stages.       51  The old south-facing entrance is presumed to have been the entrance that led to the ante-cella (Room m) from the southwest. The new east-facing entrance, which Sennacherib named the “Royal Gate” ( bāb šarrūti ), is oriented to the southeast and it may have been the entranceway between the cella (Rooms o+p) and Room q (so Frahm, Sanherib p. 172) or the entranceway leading from Room q to the courtyard of the “Ostanbau” (Börker-Klähn, ZA 70 [1980] pp. 260–261 [with fig. 2] gate a). According to H. Galter (Orientalia NS 53 [1984] pp. 440–441), the “Royal Gate” was the entranceway between the cella (Rooms o+p) and the ante-cella (Room m). For a discussion of the problems with the Akkadian terms used in text no. 166 to indicate the orientation of the gates, along with references to previous literature, see Frahm, Sanherib p. 170.      52  For information about his religious reforms, see in particular Frahm, Sanherib p. 20 and 282–288; and Vera Chamaza, Omnipotenz, pp. 111–167 §2.3.      53  So Frahm, Sanherib p. 172. J. Börker-Klähn (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 261–262 [with fig. 2] gate a'), however, suggests that the “Gate of the Path of the Enlil-Stars” ( bāb ḫarrān šūt Enlil ) provided access between Room q and Aššur’s cella (Rooms o+p). H. Galter (Orientalia NS 53 [1984] pp. 440–441) suggests that that entranceway was between Room m and the main courtyard (Haupthof). For a reconstruction of the ornate gateway created by Sennacherib, see Börker-Klähn, ZA 70 (1980) p. 273 fig. 4. For a study of the apotropaic figures, see Huxley, Iraq 62 (2000) pp. 109–137.      54  So Börker-Klähn, ZA 70 (1980) pp. 261–262 [with fig. 2] courtyard z; and Frahm, Sanherib p. 172.      55  So Frahm, Sanherib p. 172. J. Börker-Klähn (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 261–262 [with fig. 2] gates b, b', c, c', d, and d') proposes more or less the same arrangement, but regards the “Gate of the Firmament” ( bāb burūmē ), the “Kamsū-Igīgū Gate” ( bāb kamsū Igīgī ), and the “Gate of the Wagon Star” ( bāb ereqqi ) as the inner gates, and the “Gate of the Entrance of the Igīgū Gods” ( bāb nēreb Igīgī ), the “Gate of the Abundance of the Land” ( bāb ḫiṣib māti ), and the “Gate of the Dais of Destinies” ( bāb parak šīmāte ) as the outer gates. H. Galter (Orientalia NS 53 [1984] pp. 440–441), on the other hand, places the gates around the temple’s forecourt (Vorhof). According to Galter, the “Gate of Entrance of the Igīgū Gods” was located between the main courtyard (Haupthof) and Room a; the “Gate of the Firmament” probably gave Room a access to the forecourt (Vorhof); the “Kamsū-Igīgū Gate” and the “Gate of the Abundance of the Land” were located at the very southern end of the forecourt; and the “Gate of the Wagon Star” and the “Gate of the Dais of Destinies” provided access from the forecourt to the courtyard of the “Ostanbau.”       56  As suggested by E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 221), one or both of the inscriptions written on clay tablet K 6177 + K 8869 (text no. 158) may have also been written on the metal plating of the Dais of Destinies. If BM 91157 proves to be from the plating of Aššur’s dais, then the drafts (or archival copies) of the texts written on K 6177 + K 8869 may have been inscribed elsewhere on that same piece of bronze. Esarhaddon (Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 136 Esarhaddon 60 lines 26'–29'a) records that he entirely rebuilt the Dais of Destinies with  ešmarû -metal and had images of both him and his son Ashurbanipal depicted on its outer facing. If Esarhaddon had Aššur’s dais fashioned anew, then he would have had his father’s bronze plating removed. Before doing so, he probably had the inscriptions written on the earlier plating copied onto a clay tablet and archived; K 6177 + K 8869 may have been that tablet. If BM 91157 was part of the plating of the Dais of Destinies, then it appears that Esarhaddon’s craftsmen did not have the bronze plating destroyed. Of course, this interpretation of the meager written evidence must remain conjectural.      57  Other cult objects taken from Esagil in 689 were probably dedicated to the god Aššur.       58  Text nos. 160, 167–168, and 171–176.

      "text": "The City Walls and Their Gates     Royal Palaces     Sennacherib’s Royal Tomb         The Zababa Temple   As indicated by texts on several stone blocks and by two royal grants, Sennacherib constructed a temple/sanctuary for the god Zababa; that structure was either part of the Aššur temple or a separate structure located in the vicinity of the Aššur temple and the Tabira Gate. [63]  The work was probably a small part of the king’s building program that took place in Aššur after the destruction of Babylon in 689.      The Sîn-Šamaš Temple   There is some archaeological evidence to suggest that Sennacherib worked on the Sîn-Šamaš temple sometime after 689, when the king was engaged in work on the Aššur temple, the  akītu -house, and the processional way. Textual evidence, however, is lacking and, therefore, little can be said about this project. [64]        The Old Palace   Sennacherib renovated sections of the Old Palace, including the Step Gate ( mušlālu ). [65]  A complete, but very badly damaged, octagonal clay prism (text no. 164) that was inscribed ca. 691–689 (Sennacherib’s 14th–16th regnal years) records the renovation of the innermost part of that palace, the  kummu -room (possibly Room 21 or Room 22) and its cella ( kiṣṣu ). The Middle Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I (1114–1076) and the early Neo-Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (883–859) are named as previous builders and, as is typical for Sennacherib’s inscriptions, the king mentions that the earlier workmanship on the building of the palace was not skillfully executed. [66]  The superstructure of that part of the building is reported to have been completely rebuilt, roofed with cedar beams from Mount Amanus (the principal source for roof beams at this time), and had metal-banded doors made from white cedar hung in its gateways. Sennacherib also worked on the Step Gate, a project recorded in inscriptions written on stone blocks and bricks. As one expects from texts written on these two mediums, Sennacherib states that he used limestone blocks for the foundation and raised the structure of the  mušlālu  “as high as a mountain.”          The City Walls and Their Gates    The building report of a badly damaged and difficult-to-read octagonal clay prism (text no. 165) may describe Sennacherib’s restoration of Aššur’s city walls and their gates. [67]  Nothing of substance can be said about this project at present.         Royal Palaces    Sennacherib built palaces for at least two of his sons at Aššur. A single brick attests to the construction of a house for his eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi (text no. 205). The location of the building is not known, but the work must have taken place prior to 700 since Sennacherib made Aššur-nādin-šumi king of Babylon in that year. Numerous stone blocks attest to Sennacherib building a house for another of his sons, Aššur-ilī-muballissu; that house was located near the city wall in the southeastern part of Aššur, near the bank of the Tigris River (city plan quadrants l8/l9; the “Crown Prince’s Palace” in Figure 2). [68]  The dates for the building of that house are not known.          Sennacherib’s Royal Tomb     As is clear from numerous bricks discovered throughout Aššur, Sennacherib appears to have had his own tomb built during his lifetime; that structure may have included both above-ground and underground components. [69]  Like other royal tombs at Aššur (including those of Aššur-bēl-kala, Ashurnasirpal II, and Šamšī-Adad V), this tomb, which he calls the “Palace of Rest” ( ekal tapšuḫti ) on one occasion (text no. 203) and the “Palace of Sleep” ( ekal ṣalāli ) on another (text no. 204), may have been situated under the Old Palace. Its location is not known and this may in part be due to the fact that it was intentionally destroyed at a later date. [70]  It is uncertain whether or not Sennacherib was buried in it after he was murdered in late 681.

Akk.  mušlālu  is not an easy word to translate and has been interpreted in a variety of ways in scholarly literature, for example, “monumental staircase,” “monumental gate entrance,” “processional staircase,” “city gate with free(standing) staircase,” “Step Gate,” “gate,” “gatehouse,” and “a temple or palace gate with free(standing) staircase in Aššur.” For a short survey of the relevant scholarly material, see Miglus in Maul and Heeßel, Assur-Forschungen p. 232 n. 8. Following Grayson, RIMA 1,  mušlālu  is translated in RINAP 3 as “Step Gate”; E. Leichty (RINAP 4), however, opted to translate the word as “gatehouse.”      66  For details on Room 21 and Room 22, and the evidence for Tiglath-pileser I’s and Ashurnasirpal II’s work on the Old Palace, see Pedde and Lundström, Palast pp. 56–57 §§III.21–22, pp. 166–173 §III.13 and pp. 179–181 §III.18.      67  See Frahm, KAL 3 p. 33 for a suggestion on the contents of the building report.

Note that S. Parpola (SAAB 3/1 [1989] p. 24) suggests that Esarhaddon, rather than Sennacherib himself, built this royal tomb.      70  For possible locations, see in particular Frahm, Sanherib p. 181; Nasrabadi, Bestattungssitten p. 20 II.2.4; Lundström, WZKM 91 (2001) pp. 216–218; Pedde and Lundström, Palast p. 183; and Lundström, Königsgrüfte pp. 141–145 §II.6 and pp. 206–213 (with references to previous literature). It is uncertain whether Sennacherib’s tomb was located in the area of the other royal tombs or in another part of the Old Palace. E. Heinrich (Paläste pp. 112–113) and R. Hachmann (Kāmid el-Lōz 16 pp. 257–263 §9.1, especially pp. 261–262) propose that Sennacherib’s tomb was Tomb IV, while B. Hrouda (Andrae, WEA 2  p. 311 n. 173) suggests Tomb VI. E. Weidner (AfO 13 [1939–1941] p. 216 n. 74) and P. Miglus (ISIMU 6 [2003] pp. 267–268) suggest that Sennacherib’s tomb, along with the other royal tombs (those of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal), was located in another part of the Old Palace. On the assumption that text no. 203 does not deal with the grave itself, but rather with an above-ground structure in the Old Palace in which ancestor worship was carried out, while text no. 204 concerns itself with the underground tomb itself, S. Lundström (Königsgrüfte pp. 207 and 209–210) suggests that the above-ground structure was located in the southeastern part of the Old Palace, in the vicinity of the other royal tombs.      71  Frahm, Sanherib p. 181; and Frahm, PNA 3/1 p. 1123 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība II.3.c.2'.h'. Frahm points out that his grandson Ashurbanipal offered slaughtered Babylonians as a  kispu -offering at the place where Sennacherib was murdered, and not at the royal tomb; see Borger, BIWA p. 44 Prism A iv 70–73. Frahm (Sanherib p. 181) suggests that there is a possibility that the tomb was destroyed in 681, just after his murder; of course, he rightly suggests that it may instead have been destroyed in 614, when the city was conquered and destroyed by the Medes."

      "text": "Sennacherib spent a great deal of time and effort creating an extensive system of canals that brought water not only to his capital Nineveh, but also to other cities in the northern part of the Assyrian heartland. [72]  Early in his reign (ca. 702–700), Sennacherib built a canal from the city Kisiru to the plain of Nineveh; the distance from Kisiru to the Ḫusur River (mod. Khosr) was one and a half leagues (ca. 13.4 km). [73]  Sometime between 700 and 694, a more substantial irrigation system was needed in the area of Nineveh and the requisite water was found in mountain springs northeast of the city, near Mount Muṣri and the cities Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, and Sulu. Three new canals were dug to the Ḫusur River, where their waters supplemented those of that river, thus making it possible to irrigate fields upstream and downstream of Nineveh all year long. [74]  Ca. 691–688, Sennacherib had numerous canals, all presumably part of two systems (the so-called Northern and Khinnis Systems), dug in order to bring water to Nineveh and other important Assyrian cities. In inscriptions carved at Bavian (the head of the Khinnis System), Sennacherib boasts that he had eighteen canals — including the three from Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, and Sulu — dug, taking their water to the Ḫusur River; he also dug another canal, the Patti-Sennacherib (“Sennacherib’s Canal”), from Mount Tas on the border of Urartu. [75]  The Khinnis System, whose construction is recorded in the Bavian Inscription (text no. 223) and in a few of the inscriptions from Jerwan (text nos. 226–227), stretched 90 km from the gorge just northeast of the village Khinnis to the city Kisiru, via the Jerwan aqueduct; the canal’s initial 55 km needed to be excavated, but the final 34 km utilized the natural riverbed of the Ḫusur River. [76]  The Northern System, whose construction is not described in extant inscriptions of Sennacherib, is a series of canals that may be part of a single system; the interconnectivity of the individual canals has yet to be established through archaeological surveys and fieldwork. [77]  The so-called Northern System appears to have brought water from the northwest down the Wadi al-Milh to Tarbiṣu, and then Nineveh, via Bahanadawaya, Gir-e pan, Faida, and possibly Maltai.    Sennacherib also constructed a system of canals that brought water to Arbela, one of the main cult centers of the goddess Ištar (text no. 229).

T. Jacobsen identified Kisiru with Tell Inthat, but J. Reade has argued that it is the dam now known as al-Shallalat, which is located near the village Beybokh. J. Ur (Iraq 67/1 [2005] p. 322) notes that the Kisiru canal could have irrigated a maximum area of 11.8 km 2 .      74  J. Reade (RA 72 [1978] pp. 68–72; and RLA 9/5–6 [2000] p. 407 §11.7) has suggested that traces of one of the canal heads may be visible at Baʾzani, near Šibaniba, and that the project could have had its origins in canals dug by Sargon II for Dūr-Šarrukīn. As pointed out by several scholars, the logical point of confluence with the Ḫusur River would be via the Wadi Gamtar, which is in the vicinity of the village al-Ğīla; see Ur, Iraq 67/1 (2005) p. 323 (with references to earlier literature).      75  The cities listed in text no. 223 lines 8–10 are: Masitu, Banbakabna (Banbarina), Šapparišu, Kār-Šamaš-nāṣir, Kār-nūri, Talmusu, Ḫatâ, Dalāyin, Rēš-ēni, Sulu, Dūr-Ištar, Šibaniba, Isparirra, Gingiliniš, Nampagātu, Tīlu, Alumṣusi, and Ḫadabitu. Text no. 18 viii 6'–12' name canals dug from the cities Girmua and Ālum-labir, and text no. 226 states that canals were dug from the cities Ḫanusa and Gammagara. Despite Sennacherib’s claims, not all of the canals were connected to the Ḫusur River; see Ur, Iraq 67/1 (2005) pp. 325–335.      76  Ur, Iraq 67/1 (2005) pp. 335–339. Sennacherib states that the Patti-Sennacherib was dug by only a small number of men and completed within fifteen months; see text no. 223 lines 23b–26. S. Lloyd (Jacobsen and Lloyd, OIP 24 p. 6) estimates that more than two million stones were used in the construction of the Jerwan aqueduct.      77  J. Ur (Iraq 67/1 [2005] p. 326) correctly notes that the current reconstruction of the Northern System is a “product of modern scholarship rather than a documented ancient entity.” The canals making up this system may be among the eighteen canals named in text no. 223, assuming that these canals were constructed before the Khinnis System. The total length of the reconstructed Northern System is 46.4 km, with the longest segment being the Tarbiṣu Canal, which is 23.1 km long; see Ur, Iraq 67/1 (2005) pp. 325–335 and p. 340 Table 1."

      "text": "No contemporary inscriptions of Sennacherib record work at Kalḫu (modern Nimrud), but the concluding formulae of (an) inscription(s) of his grandson Ashurbanipal written on clay prisms deposited in the structure of the Nabû temple Ezida (“True House”) there imply that Sennacherib (and Esarhaddon) had renovated parts of that temple. [78] [79]  At Kilīzu (modern Qaṣr Šemāmok), bricks and stone slabs state that Sennacherib had the city wall(s) constructed (text nos. 218–219). During the early part of his reign, Sennacherib renovated Egallammes (“Palace, Warrior of the Netherworld”), the temple of Nergal at Tarbiṣu (modern Sherif Khan) (text nos. 213–216, esp. text no. 213 lines 62–68); it has been suggested that this work was inspired by Sargon’s ill-fated death in 705, which according to a text written in the time of Esarhaddon was caused by that king offending the gods. [80]  The king records that he removed the dilapidated structure down to its foundation trench, built a 200×100 cubit (ca. 110×55 m) terrace, enlarged the structure of the previous temple, and rebuilt its superstructure. Afterwards, Nergal (and presumably his consort Laṣ) were escorted back into the temple during a festive ceremony.    Bricks reported to have been found at Beisan, Šibaniba (modern Tell Billa), Tell Yarah, Tulul al-Lak (or Lak-teppeh) may attest to building operations in those cities (text nos. 220–221).

In addition to proposing that Sennacherib initiated construction on Nergal’s temple at Tarbiṣu shortly after ascending the throne, E. Frahm (JCS 51 [1999] pp. 73–90) has suggested that the Assyrian scholar Nabû-zuqup-kēnu may have studied the passage about the spirits of the deceased in Gilgamesh Tablet XII in order to elucidate the consequences of Sargon II’s death. He proposes that Sennacherib immediately transferred the royal court to Nineveh since the newly enthroned king may have feared that his father’s unburied ghost was still present at Dūr-Šarrukīn (mod. Khorsabad). For a recent study on Sargon’s death and its impact on Sennacherib, see Frahm, Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem pp. 201–206.      81  Sennacherib may have also worked on a temple in the city Šabbu; see Kataja and Whiting, SAA 12 p. 23 no. 22."

      "text": "While on his way to campaign in Babylonia ca. 691, Sennacherib camped at the reportedly abandoned and dilapidated city Sūr-marrati (probably modern Samarra), a city on the eastern bank of the Tigris, halfway between Aššur and Babylon and across the river from Ḫalulê. He decided to rebuild that city and plant gardens in the surrounding territory (text no. 230 lines 115–120a). This decision was presumably strategic; the city would provide a line of defense against any Babylonian or Elamite army marching north into Assyria. Apart from the brief report of the work in an inscription written on two stone tablets, no other information about scale and duration of the project is known. [82]    Several paving stones of breccia reused and reinscribed by the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II attest to Sennacherib sponsoring some building project in Babylon (text no. 232). These inscribed paving stones are reported to have been part of the processional way in the court leading to the main eastern gate in the enclosure wall of the ziggurrat precinct. Therefore, it is assumed that Sennacherib restored this processional way. Since Sennacherib had Babylon destroyed and left “kingless” after he captured it in 689, this work was probably undertaken during his first reign over Babylonia (704–703) or when his vassal Bēl-ibni or his son Aššur-nādin-šumi sat on the throne of Babylon (702–694).

      "text": "Sennacherib was the son of Sargon II by one of the latter’s wives. [83] [84]  His paternal grandfather was Tiglath-pileser III, and his paternal grandmother may have been Yabâ; his uncles were Shalmaneser V and Sîn-aḫu-uṣur, and one of his aunts by marriages was Bānītu. [85]  Sennacherib had several older and younger brothers and at least one sister, but almost nothing is known about them, for most of them not even their names. A sister of his, Aḫat-abīša, was married to king Ambaris of Tabal. His older brothers, as can be inferred from his name “The god Sîn has replaced the brothers” (Akk.  Sîn-aḫḫē-erība ), had died by the time Sennacherib was born. Several of his younger brothers appear to have survived him. Sennacherib had at least two wives: Tašmētu-šarrat and Naqīʾa (Zakūtu). [86]  It is not clear whether or not the position of queen could be held simultaneously by more than one woman. [87]  These women, and perhaps other women in the harem, bore Sennacherib at least six sons and one daughter.    The names of these seven children are known. Aššur-nādin-šumi was Sennacherib’s eldest son or eldest living son when Sennacherib became king in 705. It has sometimes been suggested that he may have been a son of Sennacherib and Tašmētu-šarrat. Aššur-nādin-šumi was probably born ca. 720 (or slightly earlier) since his father made him king of Babylon in 700 (Sennacherib’s 5th regnal year). In 694 (Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year), the Babylonians handed Aššur-nādin-šumi over to the Elamites, who carried him off and presumably killed him. Before sending him to Babylon, Sennacherib had had a house built for Aššur-nādin-šumi at Aššur (text no. 205). Aššur-ilī-muballissu was probably his second eldest son (or second eldest living son), as his father called him  māru terdennu  in inscriptions recording the construction of a house for him at Aššur (text nos. 179–185). He appears to have been destined for some important priestly office at birth or as a youth. Aššur-šumu-ušabši was a third son for whom Sennacherib had a house built; unlike those of his older brothers, his house was located at Nineveh (text nos. 98–100). His place in the sequence of royal children is not known, as is the case for most of the other children. Since bricks for this prince’s house were also discovered at Aššur (text no. 99), it is possible that Aššur-šumu-ušabši died before his Nineveh residence had been completed. Two other sons of Sennacherib, Urdu-Mullissu (Arad/Arda-Mullissu in earlier scholarly literature) and Nergal- šumu -[...], are mentioned in documents from Nineveh dated to 694 and 693 respectively. The former is thought to have been younger than Aššur-ilī-muballissu — although this cannot be proven — and older than Esarhaddon (see below). [88]  The mother(s) of all six of these sons is (are) not known, but it is often thought that she was Tašmētu-šarrat.     It is known that Esarhaddon, Sennacherib’s immediate successor as king of Assyria, was the son of Naqīʾa (Zakūtu). It is generally believed that that Naqīʾa was not the mother of Sennacherib’s elder children and that Esarhaddon was his youngest son since Esarhaddon claims to have been  ša  ŠEŠ.MEŠ- ia  GAL.MEŠ ŠEŠ- šú-nu ṣe-eḫ-ru a-na-ku  “I am the younger brother of my older brothers.” [89]  Esarhaddon may not necessarily have been the youngest son of Sennacherib, but rather the youngest of the sons that were eligible to be designated as heir to the Assyrian throne ca. 683 (or slightly earlier). One daughter of Sennacherib is known by name. Šadditu is explicitly called “[daug]hter of Sennacherib (and) sister of Es[arh]addon, king of Assyria”; Naqīʾa is generally considered to have been her mother, although this cannot be proven from extant textual sources. [90]     A small tablet with draft epigraphs on one side and a list of names on the other (K 6109; text no. 150) may name other sons of Sennacherib. The names of those children are: Ileʾʾi-bulluṭ-Aššur, Ilu-bulluṭ-[...], Aššur-mukanniš-ilīya, Ana-Aššur-taklāk ? , Aššur-DÙ-EN-NA (Aššur-bāni ? -bēli ? ), Šamaš-andullašu (or Šamaš-ṣalamšu), and Aššur-šākin-līti. The relationship of these individuals to Sennacherib is not certain, but the mention of Aššur-ilī-muballissu — a rare enough name and a known son of the king — in the list suggests that these individuals could be children of Sennacherib.    Sennacherib appears to have had several viable choices for a successor, but it is unclear who exactly was his first choice as heir. Furthermore, it is not certain how many times during his twenty-four years on the throne he nominated an heir, only later to appoint another son in his stead. Aššur-nādin-šumi, the king’s eldest son (or eldest living son in 705), may have been groomed for the role of ruler shortly after Sennacherib became king, just as his own father Sargon had done with him when he ascended the Assyrian throne in 722. Although there is no proof that Aššur-nādin-šumi was ever officially proclaimed heir apparent, it is likely that Sennacherib had him trained for kingship since he installed him as king of Babylon in 700 (his 5th regnal year). If Aššur-nādin-šumi had officially been regarded as the heir designate, then that position may have come to an end when his father made him king in Babylon. It is not known whether Sennacherib regarded Aššur-nādin-šumi’s tenure as king of Babylon a permanent or a temporary post and whether he intended for him to succeed him on the Assyrian throne when he died. Whether or not Aššur-nādin-šumi had ever been considered Sennacherib’s heir apparent, the matter of a successor must have weighed on the king’s mind throughout his reign. It is now generally assumed that Urdu-Mullissu, one of the king’s elder sons, was appointed, or at least was expected to be, Sennacherib’s heir in 698. [91]  However, there is no evidence that he was ever officially proclaimed as heir designate, unless the one known reference to Urdu-Mullissu as  mār šarri  refers to him being “crown prince,” rather than to him simply being “a son of the king.” [92]    The choice of an heir appears to have become an issue (again) around the king’s twenty-first (684) or twenty-second (683) year on the throne, when Sennacherib was over sixty years of age. The events or motives leading up to the official nomination of a younger son of his, Esarhaddon, in early 683 (or slightly earlier) are not recorded in extant sources, although it is sometimes assumed that Naqīʾa, Esarhaddon’s mother, played a key role in his appointment. If later, non-cuneiform sources present reliable information (although in a garbled form), it appears that the appointment came as a shock to some of Sennacherib’s sons, especially to Urdu-Mullissu who expected to be the next king of Assyria. The choice of a younger son must have ruffled more than a few feathers since Sennacherib made members of the royal family and the Assyrian population at large swear oaths of loyalty to Esarhaddon. In order to commemorate the occasion, the new heir designate was given the name Aššur-etel-ilāni-mukīn-apli (“The god Aššur, the prince of the gods, is the one who establishes the heir!”). [93]  The oaths, however, did not prevent Esarhaddon’s older brothers from conspiring against him by slandering him and telling lies about him to their father. Trusting that his father would not be influenced by the machinations of his older brothers, Esarhaddon went into exile in the western part of the kingdom. According to Esarhaddon, if he is in fact telling the complete truth, Sennacherib did not change his mind regarding the succession. That decision may have cost him his life. [94]    On the twentieth of Ṭebētu (X) 681, near the end of his twenty-fourth year as king, Sennacherib was murdered by one or more of his sons; shortly thereafter, civil war broke out, with several brothers vying for the Assyrian throne. Later cuneiform sources (a Babylonian chronicle and an inscription of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus) pin the murder on one of the king’s sons, but which one? [95]  Biblical sources (2 Kings 19:37; Isaiah 37:38; and 2 Chronicles 32:21) name  ʾdrmlk  (Adrammelek) and  śrʾṣr  (Sharezar) as the culprits, while classical sources (Berossus,  Babyloniaca  Book 3 § 3 [= Burstein, SANE 1/5 (1978) p. 24]; and Josephus,  Ant. Jud.  X 23) name Adramelos (fragment of Abydenos), Ardumuzan (fragment of Polyhistor), or Adrammelech (Josephus) as the principal murderer; Josephus also names Sarasar in connection with the murder. A damaged letter that may have recounted the events of Ṭebētu (X) 681 gives the Akkadian name of Sennacherib’s murderer: Urdu-Mullissu ( m ARAD- d NIN.LÍL, SAA 18 no. 100 obv. 10', rev. 1, 4, 6, and 11 [name not fully preserved in any of the five places]), presumably, the son of the king who is generally thought to have had the most to lose when Esarhaddon was officially nominated as heir designate. [96]  Of course, contrary to the available evidence, Esarhaddon (and his mother Naqīʾa) may have been complicit in the murder, especially if his elder brother(s) had managed to turn Sennacherib against him. Esarhaddon and Naqīʾa had the most to lose if that were the case and they would have needed to act quickly to ensure that the succession arrangement remained in their favor. Although the evidence implicates Urdu-Mullissu more than it does Esarhaddon, the identity of Sennacherib’s murderer cannot be definitively proven at the present time. Moreover, exactly where the regicide occurred is also uncertain; Babylon, Dūr-Šarrukīn, Kalḫu, and Nineveh have been proposed as possible locations. [97]  Biblical accounts state that the murder took place in the temple of  nsrk  (that is, Nusku or Ninurta). An inscription of Ashurbanipal records that he offered slaughtered Babylonians as a  kispu -offering at the place where Sennacherib was murdered, which was between (a pair of) human-headed winged bull colossi ( aladlammû ); and the city in which the  aladlammû  were placed, Nineveh, can be inferred from a Neo-Assyrian literary text describing the god Aššur’s response to a report of Ashurbanipal’s concerning the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion. [98]    After Sennacherib was murdered, civil war broke out in Assyria for a brief time. Esarhaddon, who appears to have had popular support, rushed home from exile, entered Nineveh, chased off the other pretenders to the throne, and ascended the throne of Assyria, just as his father had arranged a few years earlier.       Notes      83  Frahm, Sanherib pp. 3–4 and 18–19; Frahm, PNA 3/1 pp. 1113–1115 and 1121 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība I and II.3.b.16'; Frahm, RLA 12/1–2 (2009) pp. 13–14 §2.3; Frahm, Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem pp. 173–194 and 218–220; Fuchs, RLA 12/1–2 (2009) p. 53 §3; Fuchs, PNA 3/2 p. 1240 sub Šarru-kēnu 2.II; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 119–121; Liverani in Lippolis, Sennacherib Wall Reliefs pp. 15–17; Kwasman and Parpola, SAA 6 pp. xxvii–xxxiv; Parpola, CRRA 26 pp. 171–182; and Porter, Images, Power, and Politics pp. 13–26.       84  E. Frahm and E. Weissert (Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem p. 174 fig. 1 and pp. 179–182) suggest that Sennacherib’s mother was a woman named Raʾīmâ, and not Ataliya as generally thought.  That suggestion is tentatively followed here; see the introduction to text no. 2001 for further details.      85  As pointed out by A.R. George (Minerva 1/1 [1990] p. 31), the name Atalia and possibly the name Yabâ are northwest Semitic, suggesting that Sargon II’s and Tiglath-pileser III’s wives “were thus probably of Syrian or Levantine birth, entering the Assyrian harem as a result of diplomatic marriages or as spoils of the many western campaigns undertaken by the Assyrian armies of this period.” S. Dalley believes that Yabâ and Atalia were members of the Judean royal family (e.g., SAAB 12/2 [1998] pp. 83–98); however, there is no certain evidence for a connection between the Assyrian and Judean royal families. For reservations about Dalley’s proposal, see for example Frahm, PNA 3/1 p. 1114 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība I.1 and Younger Jr., VT 52 (2002) pp. 207–218. Dalley (New Light on Nimrud pp. 171–175; and JSOT 28 [2004] p. 395) has also suggested that Shalmaneser V’s wife Banītu (an alternative interpretation of the name Bānītu) is an Akkadian translation of West-Semitic Yabâ (meaning “beautiful”) and that Yabâ and Banītu (that is, Bānītu) are one and the same person.       86  E. Frahm (Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem p. 191 n. 124) suggests that Ana-Tašmētu-taklāk, a new queen identified by I. Finkel (NABU 2000 p. 12 no. 8), could be a wife of Sennacherib, perhaps even his first wife, but there is no firm evidence to support this proposal. That text will be included with those of Ashurbanipal and his successors. Furthermore, Frahm and Weissert (Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem p. 179) think that VA Ass 1203 (Ass 16043; text no. 2001), a stele erected in one of the row of steles at Aššur, belonged to Sennacherib’s mother (a certain Raʾīmâ) rather than one of his wives (Tašmētu-šarrat, Naqīʾa, or a woman whose name might be read as  f DÙG- x - d NIN.LÍL or  f x-x-(x)-x-la-a ).        87  It is often assumed that during the reign of Sennacherib there was only one queen at any given time. For a few recent studies on Neo-Assyrian queens — including whether Tašmētu-šarrat and Naqīʾa held the post of queen simultaneously or successively — see, for example, Frahm, Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem pp. 178–192; Kertai, AoF 40 (2013) pp. 108–124; Melville, SAAS 9; and Svärd, Power and Women.       88  Kwasman and Parpola, SAA 6 pp. 40–44 and 93 nos. 37, 39–41, and 103. The full name of Nergal- šumu -[...] may have been, for example, Nergal- šumu -[ ibni ], Nergal- šumu -[ iddin ], Nergal- šumu -[i škun ], or Nergal- šumu -[ uṣur ].      89  Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 11 Esarhaddon 1 i 8.       90  Kwasman and Parpola, SAA 6 pp. 200–201 no. 251. Whether Šadditu or another daughter of Sennacherib married an Egyptian called Šusanqu (Susinqu), a man referred to as  ḫatna šarri , “son-in-law (or brother-in-law) of the king,” is unclear (ibid. pp. 125–126 no. 142). Moreover, it is equally uncertain if the  šarru  referred to Sennacherib or some Egyptian ruler. For details and interpretations, see in particular Onasch, ÄAT 27/1 pp. 15–16; and Radner, Studies Roaf pp. 471–479.      91  Based on statements in several inscriptions (text nos. 181–182), Aššur-ilī-muballissu appears to have been designated from birth or at an early age for some important priestly office and since it is generally thought that Aššur-šumu-ušabši (although his place in the sequence of the king’s children is not known) died before 700, Urdu-Mullissu appears to have been the most suitable candidate to succeed Sennacherib ca. 698, assuming Sennacherib made such an appointment at that time.      92  For the opinion that  mār šarri  in Neo-Assyrian texts always refers to the crown prince, rather than having its literal meaning, see Kwasman and Parpola, SAA 6 pp. xxvii–xxxiv. For reservations on the exclusive use of  mār šarri  for “crown prince,” see, for example, Melville, SAAS 9 pp. 19–20.       93  As far as we can tell, the practice of nominating the eldest son as heir was by no means obligatory and, therefore, a king could choose any one of his sons. For copies of the loyalty oath, see Parpola and Watanabe, SAA 2 p. 18 no. 3; and Frahm, KAL 3 pp. 130–133 nos. 67–68.      94  According to an inscription of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus (Schaudig, Inschriften Nabonids pp. 515–516 no. 3.3a i 1'–41', esp. i 35'–41'), Sennacherib was murdered because he had sacked and destroyed Babylon in 689. Apart from that text, there is no other contemporary or later evidence to support that claim and, therefore, it is not known if the destruction of Babylon actually played any part in the murder of this Assyrian king; see Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 121.      95  Grayson, Chronicles pp. 81–82 no. 1 iii 34–35a; and Schaudig, Inschriften Nabonids p. 516 no. 3.3a i 35'–41'.       96  See Parpola, CRRA 26 pp. 171–182. For an edition of the letter 80-7-19,28, see Reynolds, SAA 18 p. 82 no. 100. The identity of  śrʾṣr  is less certain, but the writing clearly points to a hypocoristic form of an Akkadian name ending with –šarru-uṣur. E Frahm (Sanherib pp. 18–19; and PNA 3/1 p. 1115 sub Sīn-aḫḫē-erība I.3.b), following S.F. Schmidtke (AOTU 1/2 pp. 110–111), tentatively suggests that the biblical  śrʾṣr  is to be identified with Nabû-šarru-uṣur, the governor of Marqasi and eponym for the year 682. As already stated by Frahm, there is no evidence that Nabû-šarru-uṣur was a son of Sennacherib, but the possibility cannot be excluded.      97  See, for example, Frahm, Sanherib p. 19 (Nineveh); Lipiński, Dictionnaire Encyclopédique de la Bible pp. 208–209 sub Bet-Sarruk(in) (Dūr-Šarrukīn); Schmidtke, OLZ 21 (1918) cols. 169–171 (Babylon); von Soden, NABU 1990 pp. 16–17 no. 22 (Kalḫu); and Ungnad, ZA 35 (1924) pp. 50–51.       98  Borger, BIWA p. 44 Prism A iv 70–73; and Livingstone, SAA 3 p. 111 no. 44 obv. 24–25."

Text no. 205 was written sometime before 700 since Aššur-nādin-šumi was made king of Babylon in that year. Text nos. 214–216 were all probably composed during the first few years that Sennacherib sat on the throne (ca. 704–702) since the renovation of the Nergal temple at Tarbiṣu appears to have been one of this king’s first building projects, as suggested from the building report of text no. 213. Based on their contents, text no. 142 was composed in 700 or 699, text no. 135 in 699 or later, and the inscription comprising text nos. 136–139 in 699 or 698.    The years during which the bull and lion colossi stationed in Sennacherib’s palace were inscribed are not entirely certain. Based on their contents and those of texts written on octagonal clay prisms (text nos. 15–17), most of these human-headed bull and lion colossi (with the exception of the one set up in the Eastern Building) were likely inscribed in the years 695, 694, and 693. Text nos. 39–40 were written on colossi ca. 696–695, text no. 41 ca. 695; text no. 42 in late 695 or at the very beginning of 694, text no. 43 in mid- to late 694, text nos. 44 and 46 ca. late 694 to early 693, and text nos. 49–50 (the Eastern Building bulls) ca. late 693 to 691.    The  terminus post quem   for the inscriptions comprising text nos. 146–148 and 164 is the battle of Ḫalulê (691), so the texts on these tablets were likely composed 691–ca. 689. Because the inscriptions on several cylinder-shaped beads state that they were taken as booty from the Dumetu/Duma (text nos. 111–115), a city that is probably identical with Adummatu, those objects could not have been inscribed before that city’s conquest, an event that took place ca. 690. Since the building report of text no. 152 describes work on the armory at Nineveh, that text may have been written ca. 690–689 (or possibly later). The inscription comprising text nos. 143–145, as far as it is preserved, is similar to an inscription written on a six-sided clay prism (text no. 26) and to two inscriptions written on stone tablets (text nos. 34–35) and, thus, that text was probably composed around the same time as those three texts (ca. 690–687). The three horse troughs that were found north of Nineveh’s armory (text no. 132) were probably inscribed while that royal building was being constructed or shortly after its completion (ca. 690–689 or possibly later).     There are a number of inscriptions that were written after the capture and destruction of Babylon in late 689. The following texts come from that period: Text nos. 153–177, 190–198, and 209; text no. 168 may date ca. 683 since its contents are similar to a royal decree (Kataja and Whiting, SAA 12 no. 86) that is dated to Sennacherib’s 22nd regnal year. Six cylinder-shaped beads brought as an audience gift from Karib-il of Saba (text nos. 103–108) likely also date to the post-689 period because they may have been intended to be part of a foundation deposit for the  akītu -house at Aššur. Text no. 233 may have been composed ca. 683–681 since Esarhaddon may be mentioned in that inscription as  māru rabû  “senior-ranking son,” that is, Sennacherib’s heir designate.      Notes       99  I. Finkel and J. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1988] p. 253) propose that this Iddin-aḫḫē was governor of the Assyrian province Dūru, which is located along the Mediterranean coast, around the site of Tel Dor. K. Radner (RLA 11/1–2 [2006] p. 66 no. 80), however, suggests that Dūru (biblical Dor) was more likely part of the province of Megiddo since the only evidence for that city being a capital of an Assyrian province is in a fragmentary list of names, which lists provincial capitals as well as other cities."

The inscription is only known from A.H. Layard’s unpublished copies (which were made from squeezes sent to him by C.N. Williams) and a late nineteenth century copy of a squeeze once in the British Museum. Although the building report utilized some material from earlier texts written on clay prisms (698–695), which themselves are based on inscriptions on clay cylinders (ca. 702–699), many passages were composed anew for this bull inscription (or for earlier bull inscriptions). In addition, the arrangement of the contents was substantially reworked. This description of Sennacherib’s palace records: (1) the removal of the previous structure, the changing of the course of the Tebilti River, and the conversion of a 340×289-cubit area into dry land suitable for building; (2) the construction of the new terrace  and palace, with a Hittite-style portico ( bīt appāti ) and palatial halls constructed with various types of stone and wood; (3) the roofing of the palace, the hanging of doors, the creation of  latticed windows, and the decoration of parts of the brick structure with glazed baked bricks; (4) the discovery of large cedar trees in the Sirāra mountain range, alabaster at Mount Ammanāna, breccia at the city Kapridargilâ, and white limestone in the vicinity of the city Balāṭāya, resources that were used for the roof, wall and floor slabs, and numerous human-headed winged bull colossi ( aladlammu ) and sphinxes ( apsasû ); (5) the creation of numerous cast-bronze statues, including those of raging lions, human-headed winged bulls, and sphinxes; (6) the installation of stone and metal colossi as gatekeepers; (7) the erection of elaborately decorated wood and metal columns on sphinx- and lion-shaped bases; (8) the lining of the lower sections of the walls with (carved) stone slabs; and (9) the creation of a new technique for easily drawing water. The  building report concludes with a boast that Sennacherib made the palace an object of wonder and called it the “Palace Without a Rival” ( ekallu ša šānina lā īšû ). This text appears to be the earliest known bull inscription and, although the colossi are not dated, the approximate date of composition is ca. 696–695 (certainly after the composition of text no. 16). This inscription may be G. Smith’s “Bull 1” (G. Smith, Senn. p. 3).    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003513/]  or the  score  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q003513/score]  of Sennacherib 39    Sources  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q003513/sources] :    (1)   Layard, MS D pp. 24–28  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P466641/]  (Meissner and Rost, BiS pls. 6–7)       (2)   Layard, MS D p. 29  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P466642/]    Commentary   The provenance of the bulls inscribed with this text is not known with certainty since there is little information on the colossi. Layard, MS D pp. 24–29 does not record the location of the texts copied apart from stating that they were “from Kouyunjik”; according to the notation on ibid. p. 24, Layard’s copies were prepared from paper squeezes sent by C.N. Williams. J.M. Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 279) proposes Court VI, Door  k  as the provenance of the text since Layard (Discoveries p. 71) had stated that the inscription on those colossi was “nearly entire.” This is not the only possible location, as there were many other colossi in the South-West Palace for which there is little or no information. Layard copied three inscribed surfaces of one bull (ex. 1a) — which he labeled as “1,” “2,” and “3” respectively — and one inscribed surface of a second bull (ex. 2), which he referred to as “4.” The text of Layard’s “4” duplicates, with a few minor orthographic variants, the text of his “3,” thus making it certain that he copied inscriptions written on two different colossi. Layard’s numbering of the inscribed surfaces in MS D suggests that this text was inscribed on a pair of five-legged colossi, a sculpture type not mentioned by the various excavators of Sennacherib’s  palace. As already pointed out by Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 279), this does not rule out the possibility that such statues were erected in this king’s residence at Nineveh. Four-legged bulls (and lions) appear to have been the norm for colossi during Sennacherib’s reign, unlike the five-legged bulls of his predecessors’ reigns (Ashurnasirpal II, Shalmaneser III, and Sargon II). In the case of text no. 39 ex. 1, the inscription began between the front legs (lines 1–24 = Layard’s “1”), continued beneath the belly (lines 25–54 = Layard’s “2”), and concluded between the hind legs (lines 55–77 = Layard’s “3”), whereas with ex. 2, the inscription began between the back legs (missing/not copied), continued beneath the belly (missing/not copied), and concluded between the front legs (lines 66–75 = Layard’s “4”). For their editions of the building reports of Sennacherib, B. Meissner and P. Rost (BiS pls. 6–8) made use of two unnumbered squeezes then in the British Museum. The first (= “Unnumbered Cast no. 1”), which Meissner and Rost identified as originating from under the belly of a bull, is a squeeze of Layard’s “2” (MS D pp. 26–27) and the second (= “Unnumbered Cast no. 2”) belongs to one of the Court H Façade bulls (Bull 12 = text no. 44 ex. 1). “Unnumbered Cast no. 1” is probably one of the four squeezes that Williams sent to Layard. Both of these squeezes, and other squeezes in the British Museum, were destroyed by S. Smith on the grounds that they had outlived they usefulness. While working with Layard’s unpublished copies, Russell discovered that Layard, MS D pp. 26–27 (Layard’s “2”) and “Unnumbered Cast no. 1” (Meissner and Rost, BiS pls. 6–7) were the same text and confirmed Meissner’s and Rost’s identification of “Unnumbered Cast no. 1” as coming from a bull; Russell points out that Layard’s notation “sculpture?” on MS D p. 26 is the bull’s penis, which penetrates into the text below the belly (see Meissner and Rost, BiS pl. 6). Because the colossi were left at Nineveh, no dimensions for them can be given. Moreover, the text could only be edited from Layard’s unpublished copy and Meissner’s and Rost’s published copy of the (now destroyed) squeeze in the British Museum.   Based on the line divisions of the text (lines 1–10) and on the fact that this text does not include any military narration, Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 278) proposed that this text is G. Smith’s “Bull 1” (G. Smith, Senn. p. 3). He concluded that “the absence of a historical summary in this inscription [“Bull 1”] explains why Smith referred to it only for the titulary and did not mention it thereafter.” Russell’s identification is supported by the fact that the casts sent by Williams to Layard would have been available to Smith in the 1870s. For the identification of “Bull 1” with text no. 42 ex. 1, see Galter et al., ARRIM 4 (1986) p. 30 no. 6; and Frahm, Sanherib pp. 113–115 T 25–27 and T 25. Note that Frahm, Galter, Levine, and Reade were unaware of the Sennacherib text copied in Layard, MS D and, therefore, the text copied on pp. 24–29 of that unpublished manuscript was not regarded as a possible candidate for “Bull 1.”   A comparison of the building reports of text nos. 15–17, inscriptions written on clay prisms during Sennacherib’s 8th–11th regnal years (697–695), with those on Sennacherib’s colossi (text nos. 39–50), suggests that the inscriptions written on the human-headed winged bulls and sphinxes were composed ca. 696–691. The earliest of Sennacherib’s colossi were written at some point between the time text no. 16 (696–695) and text no. 17 (694) were composed. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to determine how much overlap, if any, there is between the earliest known bull inscriptions (this text and text no. 40) and the latest copies of text no. 16 (ex. 1 is dated to 3-V-695) and, thus, ca. 696–695 is tentatively given as an approximate date of composition for those texts. It is assumed, however, that the earliest known bull inscriptions were composed later than text no. 16 since they have material not included in it; that material, however, is included in at least one later prism inscription (text no. 17). Therefore, many of the differences in the accounts of the construction of Sennacherib’s “Palace Without a Rival” in text nos. 16 and 17, both in the arrangement of the material and in the contents of the individual passages, were first introduced in bull and lion inscriptions and, thus, the building reports of some of the bulls and lions edited here should be regarded as principal sources for the building report of text no. 17.   With regard to the dating of the bull and lion inscriptions, the absence of certain passages cannot be used as criteria since inclusion or exclusion of these passages is generally, but not always, determined by whether or not an entire text was written on a single colossus or on a pair of colossi. Those texts written on a single colossus generally omit these passages. The passages in question are: (1) the reference to previous kings transporting colossi at the wrong time of year, (2) the statement about Sennacherib’s predecessors ineffectually manufacturing metal statues of themselves, (3) a passage boasting about Sennacherib making significant advances in metalworking, and (4) passages recording the creation of a botanical garden, the digging of canals for irrigating fields and orchards, and the creation of a marsh. Although no two building reports are exactly the same, there are a few pieces of information that as a group can be reliably used to date the texts. The key factors include: (1) the dimensions of a plot that was converted into dry land; (2) the dimensions of the new terrace/palace; (3) the list of materials (metals, stones, woods) used to decorate the palatial halls; (4) the mention of a portico ( bīt appāti ) or a house with double doors ( bīt muterrēti ); and (5) the types of woods used for columns. Earlier bull and lion inscriptions record that Sennacherib: (1) raised a 340×289-cubit area out of the waters of the Ḫusur River (mod. Khosr); (2) built a 700×440-cubit terrace/palace; (3) built palatial halls of breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood,  musukkannu -wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and  elammaku -wood; (4) constructed a portico ( bīt appāti ); and (5) placed columns of cedar, cypress,  daprānu -juniper, and  tatīdu -wood on stone and metal bases. Later bull and lion inscriptions record that this king: (1) raised a 554×289-cubit area out of the waters of the Ḫusur River; (2) built a 914×440-cubit terrace/palace; (3) built palatial halls of gold, silver, bronze, AN.ZA.GUL.ME-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood,  musukkannu -wood, cedar, cypress, juniper,  elammaku -wood, and Indian wood; (4) constructed a house with double doors ( bīt muterrēti ); and (5) placed columns of ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and  tatīdu -wood (or of ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and Indian wood) on stone and metal bases. This text appears to be the earliest of the known bull and lion inscriptions. In additon to having all five key features of the earlier bull inscriptions stated above, this text also has: (1) the shortest description of the opening up of latticed windows in corridors and the placement of  lamassu  in gateways; (2) the briefest accounts of the discovery of a source of cedar in the Sirāra mountain range; and (3) the shortest descriptions describing the discovery of white limestone near the city Balāṭāya, the fashioning of human-headed winged bulls and sphinxes from that stone, the creation of numerous sculptures through a new bronze casting technique, the stationing of colossi at the palace gates, and the setting up of columns on stone and metal bases. Compare lines 35b–36a to text no. 43 lines 24b–28a and text no. 46 lines 127b–129a; lines 38b–41a to text no. 43 lines 33–42 and text no. 46 lines 130b–133a; and lines 45b–56a to text no. 43 lines 49b–67a and 79b–83a and text no. 46 lines 135b–139a and 143b–146a. The aforementioned passages in this text should be regarded as early versions of those passages, rather than abbreviated versions of them. Thus, a careful examination of all of the known bull and lion inscriptions points to this text being the earliest extant inscription of Sennacherib written on colossi stationed in a gateway of the South-West Palace (ca. 696–695), that is around the same time that text no. 16 was being inscribed on clay prisms.   The master text is generally ex. 1, but with some minor restorations from ex. 2. A score of lines 66–75 is presented on the CD-ROM. There are a few minor differences between Layard, MS D (ex. 1a) pp. 26–27 and Meissner and Rost, BiS pls. 6–7 (ex. 1b). These are all presumed to be errors made by one or the other modern copyist. See the on-page notes for further details. Preference is generally given to Layard’s copy (ex. 1a).    Bibliography    — Layard, MS D pp. 24–29 (exs. 1a, 2, copy)    1878 G.

The inscription is only known from an unpublished field copy of A.H. Layard. Although the inscription is badly damaged, the building report is nearly identical to that of text no. 39; a few passages have been slightly expanded and the description of the construction of Tašmētu-šarrat’s palatial hall replaces the boast about making the palace an object of wonder and naming it the “Palace Without a Rival.” Although the sphinxes are not dated, the text’s date of composition is ca. 696–695; this text is later than text no. 39.

Moreover, the text could only be editted from Layard’s unpublished copy. Like text nos. 41–43, 46, and 49–50, the text was inscribed on two colossi. The inscription began under the belly of the first lion (lines 1'–10'), continued between its hind legs (lines 1''–12'') and the hind legs of the second lion (lines 13''–29''), and then concluded under the belly of that second colossus (lines 30''–50''). Approximately the first eleven lines of the text, which would have contained Sennacherib’s titulary and the beginning of the building report, are missing. In addition, the first three or four lines of the text written between the hind legs of the first lion are completely destroyed.   Like text nos. 39, 43, and 49–50, this inscription does not include any military narration. Although the beginning of the text is completely missing and the first eleven lines preserved are badly damaged, it is fairly certain that this inscription is one of the earliest of the known bull and lion inscriptions of Sennacherib. It appears to have been composed later than text no. 39 and earlier than text nos. 42–43. Despite the fact that the passages recording the dimensions of the plot that was converted into dry land and of the new terrace/palace are completely missing and the fact that the list of materials (metals, stones, woods) used to decorate the palatial halls is badly damaged, it is clear that this text, like other earlier bull and lion inscriptions, records that Sennacherib: (1) built a portico ( bīt appāti ) and (2) placed columns of cedar, cypress,  daprānu -juniper, and  tatīdu -wood on stone and metal bases. For example, compare line 4' of this text and text no. 39 line 32 to text no. 17 vi 20 and text no. 46 line 125; and lines 39''b–41''a of this text and text no. 39 lines 65–67a to text no. 17 vii 36–38 and text no. 46 lines 149b–150a. The passages recording the discovery of white limestone near the city Balāṭāya, the fashioning of human-headed winged bulls and sphinxes from that stone, the creation of numerous sculptures through a new bronze casting technique, the stationing of colossi at the palace gates, and the setting up of columns on metal and stone bases (lines 18''–41''a) are very similar to those same passages in text no. 39 (lines 45b–68a) and, thus, indicate that this text and text no. 39 were written around the same time. Compare lines 18''–41''a of this text and text no. 39 lines 45b–68a to text no. 17 vi 62–79 and vii 9–40, text no. 43 lines 49b–67a and 79b–89a, and text no. 46 lines 135b–139a and 143b–150a. Moreover, this text also has a relatively short description of the opening up of latticed windows in corridors and the placement of  lamassu  in gateways; compare lines 6'b–10'a to text no. 17 vi 32–39, text no. 43 line 24b–28a, and text no. 46 lines 127b–129a. Variants in lines 8'–10'a, 1''–9'', 18''–20'', 31'', 33'', and 39'' indicate that this text was composed later than text no. 39; compare those lines of this text to text no. 39 lines 35b–36a, 38b–41a, 45, 51, 53, and 64. Thus, the available textual evidence points to this text being the second earliest extant inscription of Sennacherib written on colossi stationed in a gateway of the South-West Palace (ca. 696–695).   The restorations in lines 1'–7' are based on text no. 39 lines 27b–36a and those in lines 8'–10' are based on text no. 17 vi 33–41, text no. 43 lines 26–29a, and text no. 46 lines 128b–130a. The end of the building report (lines 44b''–46''), which describes the construction of quarters for Tašmētu-šarrat, Sennacherib’s wife, is unique to this text.

The text on the first bull is completely missing, but most of the text on the second bull is preserved. The inscription is known only from A.H. Layard’s unpublished field copy. Although the inscription is badly damaged, with its beginning completely lost, the text’s approximate date of composition is ca. 695. The colossi with this text appear to have been inscribed sometime between those with text nos. 39 and 40 and those with text nos. 42 and 43.

Moreover, the text could only be edited from Layard’s unpublished copy. Like text nos. 40, 42–43, 46, and 49–50, the inscription was written on two colossi. The text began under the belly of the first bull (missing/not copied), continued between the hind legs of that colossus (missing/not copied) and the hind legs of the second bull (lines 1'–19'), and then concluded under the belly of that second colossus (lines 1''–13'').   Because only a small portion of the inscription (parts of thirty-two lines) is preserved, with many of the key factors for determining a date of composition completely missing, it is difficult to know for certain when the bulls were inscribed with this text. Since this text records that Sennacherib placed columns of ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and  tatīdu -wood on stone and metal bases, the text was probably composed ca. 695, around the same time as text no. 42 and text no. 43 ex. 2. Compare lines 2''–6''a of this text, text no. 42 lines 33'b–38'a, and text no. 43 lines 85b–89a to text no. 17 vii 26–40, text no. 39 lines 61b–68a, text no. 40 lines 37''b–41''a, and text no. 46 lines 147b–150a. Given its poor state of preservation, one can only guess at whether this text is earlier or later than text no. 42 and text no. 43 ex. 2. Because this inscription was written over two colossi and because it does not include passages recording that the king improved the somber atmosphere of the palace by making the interior of the building shine like day, the creation of a botanical garden, the digging of canals for irrigating fields and orchards, and the creation of a marsh, one could very tentatively suggest that this text is earlier than text no. 42 and text no. 43 ex. 2 since both texts included all of those passages. The only evidence in support of this proposal is the fact that text no. 40, which is also written over two colossi, does not include any of the aforementioned passages. Thus, if this text is earlier than text no. 42 and text no. 43 ex. 2, the passages mentioned above were first introduced in Sennacherib’s inscriptions after the composition of this text. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the omission of the four passages mentioned above in text no. 40 and this text was not simply due to a lack of space. This text is very tentatively regarded here as the third earliest extant inscription of Sennacherib written on colossi stationed in a gateway of the South-West Palace (ca. 695). Further textual evidence will ultimately aid the dating of this inscription.   The restorations in line 1''–13'' are based on text no. 42 lines 32'b–56' and text no. 43 lines 84b–106.

The building report not only utilizes material from earlier bull inscriptions, lion inscriptions, and clay prisms, but also includes passages composed for this bull inscription (or an earlier, now-lost bull or lion inscription). Photographs of both pairs of colossi have been published (although not with the inscription legible) and one set of bulls is still in situ (Room I, Door  e ), however, the text is only known to us from A.H. Layard’s unpublished field copy (with notes on textual variants) and from his published, Neo-Assyrian typeset facsimile. In addition to all of the passages in the building reports of text nos. 39–41, the account of construction in this text includes the following passages: (1) a statement about Sennacherib’s predecessors ineffectually manufacturing metal statues of themselves, exhausting their craftsmen, and depleting resources; (2) a passage boasting about Sennacherib making significant advances in metalworking, in particular a technique for casting large bronze sculptures; and (3) passages recording the creation of a botanical garden, the digging of canals for irrigating fields and orchards, and the creation of a marsh (in which resources needed to complete the palace grew). Like all of Sennacherib’s other gateway colossi, this text is not dated. Although its  terminus post quem  is the fifth campaign (to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, king of the city Ukku), which took place in 697 (Sennacherib’s 8th regnal year), comparison of the building report with those of earlier and later bull inscriptions, lion inscriptions, and clay prisms, suggests that the approximate date of composition is late 695 or the very beginning of 694; the colossi with this text appear to have been inscribed sometime between those with text no. 41 and those with text no. 43.

The inscription began under the belly of the first bull (lines 1–31), continued between the hind legs of that colossus (missing), the hind legs of the second bull (lines 1'–25'), and then concluded under the belly of the second colossus (lines 26'–56'). Because the colossi were left at Nineveh, no dimensions can be given for them. Moreover, although photographs of both pairs of colossi have been published, the inscriptions on the photos are basically illegible and the text could only be edited from Layard’s copies. In the edition provided here, preference is given to the copy in Layard, MS A pp. 136–141 (ex. 1a), rather than to the one in Layard, ICC pls. 59–62 (ex. 1b), since Layard’s earlier field copy appears to be more accurate than his later published, Neo-Assyrian typeset one. For example, there is more text preserved at the ends of lines 26'–43' in MS A than there is in ICC and the copy in ICC entirely omits lines 37' and 44'–56'.   With regard to the provenance of ex. 1, Layard gave the location of the colossi as Room I, Door  d  (= Entrance  b , Chamber B) in ICC. Layard also gave that same location for a different pair of bulls (Layard, ICC pls. 38–42 variants), but that ascription is clearly a mistake since those colossi were erected at Court VI, Door  a , a fact confirmed by collation of the north bull (the second colossus of the pair) from a legible photograph taken by J. Reade. Moreover, Layard’s statement about the condition of the state of preservation of the text of the Room I, Door  d  colossi (“a considerable portion [of the text] remained entire” [Nineveh 2 p. 128]) and the in situ remains of the bulls when they were photographed in 1903–4 by L.W. King (J.M. Russell, Final Sack pp. 72–73 pls. 24–25) seem consisent with the text published on pls. 59–62 of Layard, ICC. Unfortunately, those two colossi have vanished completely since King’s day. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 115) tentatively proposed that the ex. 1 bulls are G. Smith’s “Bull 1” (G. Smith, Senn. p. 3). Smith’s “Bull 1,” however, is probably the inscription copied on fols. 24–28 of Layard, MS D (= text no. 39 ex. 1); for further details, see the commentary to text no. 39. Based on the very limited amount of information provided by Smith about his “Bull 2” (G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, and 86), ex. 1 of this text does not appear to have been his source for that inscription; Smith’s “Bull 2” was likely one of the Court H façade bulls (probably Bull 12). For further information on the identification of  Smith’s “Bull 2,” see the commentary to text no. 44, as well as Frahm, Sanherib pp. 113–115 and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 265–272.   With regard to the provenance of ex. 1*, it was probably written on the pair of bulls placed at Room I, Door  e  since Layard (Nineveh 2 p. 126) states that text “was so much defaced, that I was only able to copy a few lines of it.” Layard’s statement matches perfectly the state of the text copied by him in MS A pp. 135–136 and the remains of the in situ colossi; see the photographs published in Sumer 22 (1966) figs. 4–5 (Arabic Section) and J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 74 pls. 26–27. Layard’s draft copy contains the first three fragmentary lines of the surface between the hind legs of the north bull (the second colossus of the pair), then a notation “27 lines illegible,” and finally thirty-two of the thirty-three lines inscribed under the belly of that same colossus; the last line of the text was not copied. In 1966, little remained of the south bull (the first colossus of the pair) and this was probably the case in the 1840s since Layard made no note of the inscription on that bull in MS A pp. 135–136. With the exception of orthographic variants, ex. 1* duplicates lines 1'–3' and 26'–56' of ex. 1 of this text and text no. 43 lines 49–50 and 76–106. Since the first line of the surface between the hind legs and the first line of the surface under the belly of this bull (the second colossus of the pair) start at exactly the same points as the third and fourth inscribed surfaces of the ex. 1 bulls, Russell (Writing on the Wall pp. 272–273) proposes that the text copied by Layard on pp. 135–136 of MS A is a duplicate of the text copied by him on pp. 136–141 of that same manuscript (ex. 1a of this text); this, the first bull of the pair (the south bull) would have also begun with a summary of Sennacherib’s first five campaigns. Because little more than the feet of the colossus are preserved today, Russell’s proposal cannot be confirmed and, therefore, the text on that bull colossus is included here as an exemplar of uncertain attribution. Ex. 1* could be a duplicate of this text, text no. 43, or another bull inscription. Note that the statement by Galter, Levine, and Reade (ARRIM 4 [1986] p. 30 nos. 6–7) that the lineation of ex. 1* is exactly the same as that of ex. 1 is not correct.   Based on the  terminus post quem  of ex. 1 — the fifth campaign, which took place in 697 — Frahm (Sanherib p. 115) proposes that colossi in Room I, Door  d  were inscribed ca. 696. Although this may be true, it is more likely that these bulls were inscribed later, probably in late 695 or at the very beginning of 694. For further information, see the commentary to text no. 43.   With some minor variation, lines 1–12a duplicate text no. 44 lines 1–23, and lines 12b–56' duplicate text no. 43 lines 6b–106. Restorations are based on those inscriptions. The master text is generally ex. 1, with the exception of lines 1'–3' and 26'–56', which are a conflation of exs. 1 and 1*. A score of lines 1'–56' is presented on the CD-ROM. Exs. 1a and 1b are treated as a single exemplar in the score. Some differences between Layard’s earlier, more accurate draft copy and his later published copy are noted in the on-page notes.

Photographs of both pairs of the colossi in situ have been published but the inscriptions are not legible on them. Thus, the text is only known from A.H. Layard’s unpublished field copy (with notes on textual variants) and from his published Neo-Assyrian typeset facsimile, as well as a photo, copy, and transliteration by A. al-Zibari. Apart from the dimensions of the area converted into dry land and of the palace, the building report is identical to that of text no. 42. The two measurements are 554×289 cubits and 914×440 cubits in ex. 1; 340×289 cubits and 914×440 cubits in ex. 2; and 340×[2]89 cubits and 7[00×440] cubits in text no. 42. The two pairs of colossi bearing this text were probably inscribed mid- to late 694. The ex. 2 bulls likely had their inscription written on them not long after those bearing text no. 42 were inscribed with that text and the ex. 1 colossi were probably inscribed not long before the bulls bearing text nos. 44 and 46; see the commentary for details.

The inscription began under the belly of the first bull (lines 1–29), continued between the hind legs of that colossus (lines 30–53), between the hind legs of the second bull (lines 54–77), and then concluded under the belly of the second colossus (lines 78–106). The colossi were left at Nineveh and thus no dimensions can be given for them. Although photographs of both pairs of colossi have been published, the text could only be edited from Layard’s copies, except for ex. 2c, the text under the belly of the second bull of ex. 2, which was collated from an unpublished photograph taken by J. Reade. For photographs of the bulls in situ, see el-Wailly, Sumer 21 (1965) Arabic section fig. 2 (after p. 10); J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 46 figs. 27–28, p. 60 pls. 6–7 and p. 98 pl. 60; and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 334 fig. 107 and p. 338 fig. 113. Those photographs, however, are not legible enough for proper collation of the inscriptions.   With regard to the provenance of ex. 1, Layard gave the location of the colossi as Room I, Door  c  (= Entrance  c , Chamber B) in ICC. That location can be confirmed from the in situ remains; see, for example, the mostly illegible photograph published in J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 60 pl. 6. Furthermore, the text and lineation of al-Zibari’s transliteration of the north bull at that entrance (Bayn al-Nahrayn 63/64 [1988] pp. 151–154) agree entirely with the text of ex. 1 (lines 1–53), with the following three exceptions: line 16, al-Zibari has 5 ME 54, not 4 ME 54; line 24 has  i -< na >  ba-rak-ki ; and line 48 has URU. kap-ri-da-ar -< gi >- la-a . All of these variants can be explained as errors in Layard’s copies or al-Zibari’s transliteration. Note that since the time Russell photographed ex. 1 Bull 1, it has been further damaged and nothing remains in situ; see Lippolis, Sennacherib Wall Reliefs pl. 18.   With regard to ex. 2, Layard wrongly assigned its provenance to Room I, Door  d  (= Entrance  b , Chamber B) in ICC; that entrance is the location of text no. 42 ex. 1. A photograph taken by Reade (ca. 1969) confirms that ex. 2 comes from Court VI, Door  a  of the South-West Palace since the text and lineation of ex. 2c match exactly those of Layard, MS A pp. 141–148 variants and pp. 148–151 (ex. 2a) and Layard, ICC pls. 38–42 variants (ex. 2b). We thank Reade for generously providing us with this photograph; the photo is almost identical to the one published on Lippolis, Sennacherib Wall Reliefs pl. 128 (top image). Layard describes the colossi in Court VI, Door  a  as “very dilapidated” and his field copies (MS A pp. 148–151) provide us with an excellent example of his method of copying duplicate inscriptions. Layard began in the middle of the inscription, with the text between the legs of the second bull of the pair (= his Bull 1), and fully copied all twenty-two lines of that surface. Layard then began copying the text under the belly of that same bull. He copied the first twelve lines and part of the thirteenth line, at which time he realized that this text was a duplicate of the inscription that was written on the colossi in Court H, Door  c  (ex. 1), which he had just copied, and he, therefore, stopped copying the text. At this point, the copy breaks off with the note “rest compared with previous inscription—variants & restored passages noted beneath.” Layard then went back to his copy of the inscription that was written on the Court H, Door  c  bulls (MS A pp. 141–148) and began listing beneath each line the variants from the bulls in Court VI, Door  a . Without reference to lineation, he first noted the variants for the end of the inscription (beginning with the thirteenth line under the belly of the second bull [= his Bull 1]), and then noted the variants for the entire text of the first bull of the pair (= his Bull 2). Layard gave the variants in parentheses and basically the same variants are given as notes in his published copy in ICC. Sometimes the variants are just variant sign forms and these are not noted in this edition. Other times they are different signs and these are, of course, given here in the on-page notes. Usually the variants given in Layard, MS A agree with those published in Layard, ICC, but sometimes they differ. Where this happens, and they are all minor variants, we have noted the divergence.   A small fragment of a colossus from the South-West Palace is in the California Museum of Ancient Art (CMAA), Los Angeles. Because parts of only four lines (part of the prologue and the very beginning of the building report) are preserved and because those lines duplicate lines 4–8 of this text and text no. 49 lines 4–10, the CMAA piece is included here as an exemplar of uncertain attribution (ex. 1*).   Apart from orthographic variants and the dimensions of the plot of land that Sennacherib had converted into dry land and of the new palace, the building reports of this text and text no. 42 are identical and, therefore, both texts are presumed to have been written around the same time. Text no. 42 ex. 1 records the two dimensions as 340×[2]89 cubits and 7[00×440] cubits respectively, ex. 1 of this text as 554×289 cubits and 914×440 cubits, and ex. 2 of this text as 340×289 cubits and 914×440 cubits. Thus, the bulls with text no. 42 ex. 1 were probably inscribed first, then those with ex. 2 of this text, and finally the bulls with ex. 1 of this text. It is certain that the  terminus post quem  of text no. 42 ex. 1 is the fifth campaign (697), and, thus, the earliest that the bulls in question were inscribed is 696.   Taking into account the placement of the bulls in the South-West Palace — in entrances to the throne room suite (Rooms I–V, Court H, and Court VI) — as well as the assumption that these three pairs of bulls were inscribed around the same time, we suggest that this text and text no. 42 were both composed in 695, perhaps during the second half of that year, and that some of the bulls in Sennacherib’s palace were inscribed with at least one of these texts during 694. Mid- to late 695 is suggested as the original date of composition of the inscription for the following reasons: (1) the dimensions of the plot of land that Sennacherib had converted into dry land and of the new palace in text no. 17 are respectively 340×289 (v 91–vi 1) and 700×440 (vi 11–12); and (2) at least six bulls in the throne room suite were inscribed approximately late 694 to early 693 (text nos. 44 and 46), which is clear from their  terminus post quem , the first part of his sixth campaign, which took place in 694 (Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year).   With regard to the first point, given the fact that none of Sennacherib’s colossi bear dates, it is impossible to know for certain the precise chronological relationship between exs. 1 and 2 of this text and text no. 17, both of whose principal exemplars were inscribed in Abu (V) 694. At first glance, one would be inclined to date both exemplars of this text after text no. 17, since the dimensions of the plot converted into dry land and of the palace are higher in this text than they are in text no. 17. However, one should not rule out the possibility that this text is slightly earlier than or contemporaneous with that prism inscription. It is clear that (1) the building reports of Sennacherib’s bull and lion inscriptions were primary sources for the building report of text no. 17; (2) text nos. 15 and 16, whose accounts of the construction of the “Palace Without a Rival” are based on earlier cylinder and prism inscriptions, were primary sources for some of the passages of the accounts of construction in the earliest bull and lion inscriptions; and (3) text no. 17 was a primary source for some of the passages in the building reports of later bull and lion inscriptions. It took some time, it appears, to fully incorporate new material from text no. 17 into texts written on human-headed winged bulls and sphinxes. That process can be traced from text no. 17 to text no. 44 and from the latter inscription to text no. 46; text nos. 44 and 46 were both certainly written after text no. 17 since the  terminus post quem  for those texts is the first part of Sennacherib’s sixth campaign. Like text no. 17, the building report of text no. 44 lists gold, silver, bronze, AN.ZA.GUL.ME-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood,  musukkannu -wood, cedar, cypress, juniper,  elammaku -wood, and Indian wood as the materials used to decorate palatial halls (lines 41b–42). It also states that Sennacherib constructed a house with double doors ( bīt muterrēti ) (line 43) and lists ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and Indian wood as the types of woods used for columns (line 65). Text no. 44, however, follows earlier bull, lion, and prism inscriptions in its description of the demolition of the former palace and altering the course of the Tebilti River (lines 36b–39a); cf. text no. 17 v 84–vi 4a. Like text no. 44, the building report of text no. 46 records that gold, silver, bronze, AN.ZA.GUL.ME-stone, breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood,  musukkannu -wood, cedar, cypress, juniper,  elammaku -wood, and Indian wood were used to decorate palatial halls (lines 123b–124a). That text also states that Sennacherib constructed a house with double doors ( bīt muterrēti ) (line 125) and mentions that trunks of ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and Indian wood were used for columns (lines 149b–150a). Moreover, the building report of text no. 46 also uses the description of demolishing the former palace and altering the course of the Tebilti River (lines 116b–121a) used in text no. 17 (v 84–vi 4a). Text no. 46, however, still uses the earlier description of the digging of canals for irrigating fields in the vicinity of Nineveh (lines 154b–156), rather than the one included in text no. 17 (viii 22–42); of course, this may have been due entirely to space considerations. Exs. 1 and 2 of this text (text no. 43) list breccia, alabaster, elephant ivory, ebony, boxwood,  musukkannu -wood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and  elammaku -wood as the materials used to decorate palatial halls (lines 20b–21a), and state that Sennacherib constructed a portico ( bīt appāti ) (line 22). They also list ebony, cypress, cedar,  daprānu -juniper, juniper, and  tatīdu -wood as the types of woods used for columns (line 88). Therefore, this text must have been written during a period when the contents of text no. 17 were not yet being incorporated into texts inscribed on human-headed winged bulls and sphinxes. Thus, the bulls in Court VI, Door  a  and Room I, Door  c  were probably inscribed either shortly before the composition of text no. 17 (early 694), around the same time as that prism inscription (mid-694, around the month Abu [V]), or shortly after that edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  (mid-694, either during Ulūlu [VI] or Tašrītu [VII]). If it is assumed that the dimensions are the primary clues to dating, then both sets of bulls with these were inscribed shortly after the composition of text no. 17. Furthermore, both pairs of bulls would have been inscribed shortly before the bulls inscribed with text nos. 44 and 46.   The proposed date of composition is entirely consistent with that of other bull inscriptions of the throne room suite, the second point cited above. The Court H façade bulls (text no. 44) and the Room I, Door  a  bulls (text no. 46) — all of which are in the vicinity of the bulls inscribed with ex. 1 of this text (Room I, Door  c ) and text no. 42 (Room I, Doors  d  and  e ) — were inscribed no earlier than late 694 and no later than early 693. Based on the contents of the building reports (see above), both text no. 44 and text no. 46 were composed shortly after this text (and text no. 42). Assuming that both exemplars of this text were inscribed on their respective colossi not long after the fifth month of 694 (the date of text no. 17 exs. 1–2), then we may conjecture that Sennacherib first had the Court VI, Door  a  bulls inscribed with the text, then had this text written on the Room I, Door  c  bulls and (shortly thereafter) text no. 44 written on the Court H façade bulls, and, finally, had the Room I, Door  a  bulls inscribed with text no. 46 (not long after that). With regard to the throne room suite, this leaves the bulls in Court H, Door  b , about which we know nothing since they were entirely missing in Layard’s day, and the Room I, Doors  d  and  e  bulls, which were probably inscribed with text no. 42. Presumably, those would have also been inscribed around the same time. Although the  terminus post quem  for text no. 42 ex. 1 is the fifth campaign, which took place in 697, the Room I, Door  d  bulls must have been inscribed much later based on the colossi’s proximity to the bulls inscribed with text nos. 43, 44, and 46. Thus, those bulls must have been inscribed not long before the other throne room suite colossi, possibly earlier in the year, Nisannu (I) to Duʾūzu (IV) 694, or possibly even late in the year 695. One could suggest that text no. 42 dates to early 694, rather than to 696 or 695, based on the argument that the omission in that text of the summaries of the campaigns that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695) could be because (1) Sennacherib had not yet decided to include reference to those military victories since he was not the person who led them and/or (2) there may not have been sufficient space to include statements about those campaigns on the Room I, Door  d  bulls; compare, for example, text no. 43 ex. 2, which did not have room to include reference to the new technique invented by Sennacherib for drawing water (lines 90b–92a), a passage of approximately the same length as the summaries of the campaigns of 696 and 695 in text no. 44 (lines 24–25a). Thus, one should not exclude the possiblity that text no. 42 ex. 1 is later in date than its  terminus post quem  would suggest. Note that at least one copy of text no. 16, an edition of Sennacherib’s  res gestae  whose  terminus post quem  is also the fifth campaign, was written in mid-695, and, therefore, a date of composition in mid- to late 695 would not be inconsistent with other texts whose military narration ends with the attacks on the inhabitants of the Mount Nipur region and on Maniye of the city Ukku. Thus, a date of composition as early 694, or even late 695, for text no. 42 fits both the extant textual and archaeological records. Taking into account that text’s placement in the South-West Palace, a later date, rather than an earlier one, is preferred here. In sum, it appears that all of the throne room suite bulls  (Rooms I–V, Court H, and Court VI) could have been inscribed in 694 and early 693.   Although this inscription is slighly later in date than text no. 42, it may have omitted the military narration due to lack of space. The engraver would have needed room for an additional ca. 9–10 lines of text (with ca. 30–40 signs on each line) to include the summary of Sennacherib’s first five campaigns and it is clear from ex. 2 that the surfaces of the Court VI, Door  a  bulls did not have sufficient space to include the entire building report. Ex. 2 omits the reference to the technique invented by Sennacherib for drawing water (lines 90b–92a). As Russell has already stated, it appears that each set of colossi in the South-West Palace was inscribed with a unique inscription, that is, no two sets of bulls or lions bore the exact same text. Since the sizes of the surface areas on each colossus or pair of colossi varied, the text inscribed on them had to be customized to fit the space into which it was to be carved. This text and text no. 42 best illustrate that fact.   With minor variations, lines 6b–106 duplicate text no. 42 lines 12b–56'. Restorations are based on that inscription. The master text is generally ex. 1, but with a few restorations from ex. 2. A score is presented on the CD-ROM. Exs. 1a, 1b, and 1c are treated as a single exemplar in the score, as are exs. 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d. Since there is no full text for ex. 2, ellipses appear in the score for the portions of that exemplar where Layard did not fully copy the text, where no variant is given by Layard, and where the text is not legible or visible from published and unpublished photographs. Some differences between Layard’s earlier, more accurate draft copies and his later published copy are noted in the on-page notes. In the edition provided here, preference is given to the copies and variants in Layard, MS A, rather than to those in Layard, ICC pls. 38–42 (ex. 1b), since Layard’s earlier field notes appear to be more accurate than his later published, Neo-Assyrian typeset copies.

Layard’s unpublished field copies, G. Smith’s published (composite) Neo-Assyrian typeset copy, a late nineteenth century copy of a squeeze once in the British Museum, in situ fragments (photographs published by J.M. Russell), and fragments now in the Vatican Museum (Rome) and the Kestner Museum (Hannover). Because the text is written on a single bull, rather than on a pair of bulls (like text nos. 41–43 and 46), the building report omits and abbreviates several passages concerning the construction of Sennacherib’s palace. The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the first part of Sennacherib’s sixth campaign, which took place in 694 (Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year), and thus the approximate date of composition is late 694 to early 693; the colossi with this text appear to have been inscribed shortly before those with text no. 46. Exs. 1 and 2 may be G. Smith’s “Bull 3” and “Bull 2” (G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, 86 and 88–89) respectively. The three fragments of ex. 1 in Rome are referred to in previous literature as the “Papal Bull”; those pieces were given as a gift to Pope Pius IX in 1855. Ex. 3 is called the “Hannover Bull” in earlier editions and studies; that piece is named after the city in which it now resides.

Dr. 1 no. 33  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P466653/]    Commentary   In a popular account of his explorations in Ottoman lands, A.H. Layard (Discoveries p. 138) reported the following about the Court H façade bulls: “On the four bulls of the façade were two inscriptions, one inscription being carried over each pair, and the two being of precisely the same import.” Layard and F.C. Cooper made at least two drawings of the in situ remains of Court H, the “Grand Entrance,” Slabs 10–12 (= Bull 10, Slab 11, and Bull 12), images that not only show the state of preservation of the colossi and their inscriptions, but also a glimpse of how Layard unearthed the long lost ruins of Sennacherib’s palace (the so-called “Kouyunjik King”). For reproductions of Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 and Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b, see J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 66 pls. 16–17. Since the drawings did not include accurate, legible copies of the inscribed surfaces of the colossi, since most of the then-known bull inscriptions were written on pairs of colossi, and since there are no surviving copies or squeezes of the texts, Layard’s statement about the text written on the Court H façade bulls was not called into question. This assessment of Layard’s, however, has caused a great deal of confusion, especially with regard to identifying these bulls with Smith’s “Bull 3” and “Bull 2” (see below). In 1989–90, J.M. Russell carefully re-examined and photographed the in situ remains of all four Court H façade bulls, documenting their progressive and extensive deterioration since Layard’s initial discovery; on the poor state of preservation of the colossi, see J.M. Russell, Final Sack pp. 61–62 pls. 8–9 and 11, pp. 67–68 pls. 18–20 and pp. 199–202 pls. 202–207. Although little remained of the inscribed surfaces, Russell was able to significantly improve our understanding of the text written on those once majestic colossi adorning one of the grand entrances of the South-West Palace. The most important discovery was the fact that each bull was inscribed with a complete text and that all four bulls were inscribed with the exact same text, and not as stated by Layard, “one inscription being carried over each pair.” Thus, the Court H façade bulls are like the colossi inscribed with text nos. 39 and 45; copies of this text were inscribed on a single colossus, rather than on a pair of colossi, like the other throne room suite bulls (text nos. 42–43 and 46). On exs. 1 and 2, the inscription began between the hind legs and concluded under the belly, but, in exs. 3 and 4, the inscription began under the belly and concluded between the hind legs. See below for details on the lineation of the edition.   Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 and Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b show the state of preservation of Bulls 10 and 12 as they were in Layard’s day. The inscribed surfaces of both colossi were fairly intact at that time. The surface beneath the belly of Bull 10 (ex. 4) is preserved, with the exception of the first half of the first fifteen lines, which are broken away. The surface between the hind legs of that bull is fully intact. The surface between the hind legs of Bull 12 (ex. 1) is completely preserved and most of the surface beneath its belly is preserved. Layard does not appear to have copied the texts since no facsimiles have been found in his notebooks (MS A, MS B, MS C, and MS D), perhaps because he made paper squeezes (see below). When T. Madhloom re-excavated Sennacherib’s throne room suite (Rooms I–V, Court H, and Court VI) for the Iraq Department of Antiquities and Heritage in 1965–71, little of those two colossi survived, as suggested by the remains recorded in a plan published in Sumer 23 (1967; pl. IX after p. 82, English section); those in situ remains more or less correspond with the photographs of the colossi published by Russell (Final Sack pp. 67–68 pls. 18–20 and p. 202 pl. 207). Thus, Layard’s Bull 10 and Bull 12 have disappeared almost completely since their initial discovery. Even less is known about the state of preservation of Bulls 1 and 3 in Layard’s day, presumably since both colossi were already in very poor condition. Layard may have made paper squeezes of some of the extant text (see below). Although Layard and later nineteenth century excavators backfilled most of the trenches and tunnels in the throne room area — L.W. King reports that he had to re-excavate this section of the South-West Palace in search for clay tablets — some of the sculptures were removed from the site by European visitors. For example, G. Bennhi sent three fragments of one of the Court H façade bulls, possibly Bull 12 (ex. 1), to Pope Pius IX in 1855; those fragments (VAT/15022, VAT/15023, and VAT/15024) are now in the Vatican Museum in Rome. In 1855, the Court H façade bulls were probably exposed, as H.C. Rawlinson uncovered them in 1854 in order to saw off the inscribed surfaces of the Court H, Door  a  bulls (see the commentary to text no. 46); presumably, he did not backfill the area. The fragment presented to the Kestner Museum in Hannover (no. 1891,12) in 1860 was probably also left exposed by Rawlinson in 1854; the Hannover fragment, which was sawn and trimmed on three sides — probably to highlight the mention of Hezekiah — was “brought from Maskat [Oman] in 1860 and presented to the Museum, said to be from Nineveh” (Galter et al., ARRIM 4 [1986] p. 32 A). For details about the destruction and deterioration of the throne room suite sculptures, see J.M. Russell, Final Sack pp. 45–51.   Layard probably made paper squeezes of some of the extant text of the Court H Bulls and Smith is generally thought to have made use of at least two of these for his editions of Sennacherib’s annals; these are probably the sources for his “Bull 2” and “Bull 3” (see below). For their editions of building reports of Sennacherib, B. Meissner and P. Rost (BiS pl. 8 = “Unnumbered Cast no. 2”) made use of an unnumbered squeeze then in the British Museum; this is likely one of the squeezes made by Layard during his excavations of Sennacherib’s throne room suite at Nineveh (see below). Unfortunately, none of those squeezes survive today since S. Smith had them destroyed.   There has been much ink spilt over the identification of the bulls from which Meissner’s and Rost’s “Unnumbered Cast no. 2” (BiS pl. 8) and Smith’s “Bull 2” and “Bull 3” (G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, 86 and 88–89) originate. As already pointed out by Russell (Writing on the Wall pp. 267–268 and 280–281), Meissner and Rost, BiS pl. 8 probably comes from under the belly of Bull 12 (ex. 1) since the copy of the squeeze then in the British Museum duplicates the sign forms and lineation of two of the fragments in the Vatican Museum (except for one variant, which is likely a modern copyist error) and since the lineation of that copy matches perfectly the in situ remains of Bull 12. Thus, Meissner and Rost, BiS pl. 8 (= BM —; squeeze), J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 202 pl. 207, VAT/15022 and VAT/15023 + VAT/15024 are tentatively edited together as a single exemplar (ex. 1).   The identification of Smith’s “Bull 2” and “Bull 3” has proven to be even more of a challenge. This is due in part to Layard’s statement in Discoveries (p. 138) that each pair of Court H façade bulls carried a single inscription and in part to the lack of information published by Smith (Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, 86 and 88–89) about these two sources, which he published as a conflated text, noting the occasional textual or orthographic variant. For the text’s prologue (“Bull Inscription, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Lines 1 to 10”), he conflates the contents of three sources: “Bull 1,” “Bull 2,” and “Bull 3”; the lineation for this section matches exactly that of a text copied on pp. 24–28 of Layard, MS D (text no. 39 ex. 1a) and that text must have been the source for Smith’s “Bull 1.” For his editions of the reports of Sennacherib’s first five campaigns and the campaigns that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695), however, Smith uses two sources: “Bull 2” and “Bull 3.” Four variants are given for the conflated edition of Smith’s “Bull 1,” “Bull 2,” “Bull 3”:  a-bu  “father” for AD in line 5 (lineation of Bull 1); the addition of  ina ta-mir-ti kiš .KI “in the plain of Kish” after  i-na ta-ḫa-az  EDIN “in a pitched battled” in line 7;  e-la-me-e  “Elamites” for LÚ.ELAM.MA.KI in line 10; and the addition of  tar-bit bir-ki-ia  “(whom I) raised on my (own) knee” after DUMU- ú-a reš-tu-ú  “my first-born son” in line 11.   There is a general consensus in previous studies and editions that the inscription on the Room I, Door  d  bulls (text no. 42 ex. 1), an inscription long known from Layard, ICC pls. 59–62, was not the source for Smith’s “Bull 2,” even though that text includes the aforementioned variants  ina ta-mir-ti kiš .KI “in the plain of Kish” and  tar-bit bir-ki-ia  “(whom I) raised on my (own) knee.” The principal evidence is twofold: (1) the orthography of Layard, ICC pls. 59–62 is not consistent with that of G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68 and 86; and (2) the historical narration of Layard, ICC pls. 59–62 ends with a summary of the fifth campaign, but that of Smith’s “Bull 2” (G. Smith, Senn. p. 86) ends with a one-line summary of the campaign that took place in the eponymy of Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695). For further details, see J.M. Russell, Programmatic Study pp. 29–33 and 36–41; Galter et al., ARRIM 4 (1986) pp. 28–30 nos. 2–3; Frahm, Sanherib pp. 113–115 T 25–27; and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 270–272. Galter, Levine, and Reade, as well as Frahm, assumed that Smith used Layard, ICC pls. 59–62 and proposed that that inscription was the source of Smith’s “Bull 1.” As it turns out, that assumption is not correct. In fact, Layard, MS D pp. 24–28 (text no. 39 ex. 1a), not  Layard, ICC pls. 59–62, is the source for “Bull 1”; for details, see the commentary to text no. 39.   Previous studies and editions generally agree that the Court H bulls were the sources for Smith’s “Bull 2” and “Bull 3,” but disagree on which bull(s). All earlier attempts to identify Smith’s sources have been hampered by the assumption that each pair of bulls (Bulls 1+3 and Bulls 10+12) on the façade of Court H carried an entire inscription. In his doctoral study, Russell (Programmatic Study pp. 31–33) concluded that both pairs of bulls (Bulls 1+3 and Bulls 10+12) served as the source for “Bull 3”; at that time, he thought “Bull 2” was Layard, ICC pls. 59–62. Based on the lineation and state of preservation (see Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 and Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b), Galter, Levine, and Reade (ARRIM 4 [1986] pp. 28–30 nos. 2–3) tentatively suggested that Bulls 10+12 were the source for “Bull 2” and that Bulls 1+3 were the source for “Bull 3.” Frahm (Sanherib pp. 113–116) followed the suggestion of Galter, Levine, and Reade. However, as Bulls 1, 3, 10, and 12 each contained a complete inscription (see above), those proposals must be amended. The lineation of “Bull 3” is consistent with that of a text inscribed between the hind legs and, therefore, only Bull 3 and Bull 12 are potential candidates. The lineation of the in situ remains of Bull 3 does not correspond to that of G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, 86 and 88–89, so that colossus can be ruled out. As already concluded by Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 266), Court H, Bull 12 is the most likely candidate for Smith’s “Bull 3”; that colossus’ state of preservation in Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 and Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b support Russell’s proposal. Assuming the lineation of “Bull 2” and “Bull 3” were similar, then Court H, Bull 3 is a possible candidate for Smith’s “Bull 2.” Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 269), who first proposed this identification, suggests that the omission of the report of Sennacherib’s sixth campaign was because Smith had no record of the in situ remains, which preserved an account of that campaign, and thus used only the part of that bull that preceded the sixth campaign. Assuming that the lineation of “Bull 2” and “Bull 3” was not similar, one could tentatively suggest that Court H, Bull 1 or Bull 10 was the source for “Bull 2.” Bull 10 is unlikely since part of the sixth campaign was preserved on that bull (see Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 and Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b). Very little is known about Bull 1, so no evidence for or against it being the source for “Bull 2” can be offered. Court H, Bull 3 is tentatively regarded here as Smith’s “Bull 2.” In the edition presented below, “Bull 2” is edited as ex. 2 (along with the other Court H, Bull 3 sources) and “Bull 3” is edited as ex. 1 (along with the other Court H, Bull 12 sources).   The fragment in the Kestner Museum in Hannover (no. 1891,12) originates from under the belly of a colossus and could belong to either Court H, Bull 1 (ex. 3) or Bull 10 (ex. 4). This piece is arbitrarily edited as coming from Bull 1 (ex. 3). Should that fragment come from Bull 10 (ex. 4), then the  terminus post quem  for its destruction can be established as 1860 since the piece was presented to the Kestner Museum in that year. E. Bleibtreu (Barnett et al., Sculptures from the Southwest Palace 1 p. 49 no. 8d) has tentatively suggested that a photograph taken during King’s 1903–4 excavations (ibid. 2 pl. 25 no. 8d) shows the in situ remains of Bull 10, Slab 11, and Bull 12. Russell, however, has pointed out that this attribution is unlikely since the east wall of Room I is largely missing and, therefore, these may have been two of the bulls discovered by King in the southwestern section of the palace. In that area of the palace, King found part of an entrance façade, of which he uncovered one pier consisting of two bull colossi and a “Gilgamesh” figure. For additional photographs of that area of the palace, which was ca. 18.3 m southwest of Layard’s outer (grand) façade, and the problem of determining the actual position and alignment of the new façade in relation to Layard’s plan of the palace, see Barnett et al., Sculptures from the Southwest Palace 1 pp. 34–36 (Turner) and p. 143 nos. 788–789 (Bleibtreu); and 2 pl. 521 nos. 788–789. However, should that photograph prove to be of Bulls 10 and 12, the bull fragment in the Kestner Museum cannot have come from Bull 10 since the inscribed surfaces of the left-facing colossus are intact.   The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the first part of Sennacherib’s sixth campaign, which took place in 694, and thus the approximate date of composition is late 694 to early 693. Based on the contents of the building report, the Court H façade bulls appear to have been inscribed with this text shortly after the colossi in Court H, Door  c  were inscribed with text no. 43 and shortly before the bulls in Court H, Door  a  were inscribed with text no. 46. See the commentary to text no. 43 for further information.   The lineation and master text follow ex. 1 for lines 1–49, ex. 2 for lines 57–73 (with restorations from ex. 3), and ex. 3 for lines 50–56. Note that ex. 1 lines 1–32, the text and lineation of which are based entirely on Smith’s transliteration (Senn. pp. 3, 30–31, 51–52, 67–68, 86 and 88–89), could very well be a composite text of his “Bull 2” (ex. 2) and “Bull 3” (ex. 1). Furthermore, the lineation of lines 1–7 here is conjectural since the lineation of the prologue in G. Smith, Senn. p. 3 followed the lineation of his “Bull 2” (text no. 39 ex. 1). The building report and concluding formulae (lines 32b–73) duplicate (with some variation) text no. 42 lines 12b–15a, 21b–15'a, 28'b–42'a, and 52'–56'; text no. 43 lines 6b–9a, 14b–67a, 79b–93a, and 101b–106; and text no. 46 lines 106b–109a, 116b–139a, 143b–153a, and 161b–164. The restorations are based on those texts. A score is presented on the CD-ROM. Since Smith (Senn. pp. 3 and 30–31) suggests that the prologue and summaries of the first and fourth campaigns were preserved on his “Bull 2,” ellipses (...) appear for ex. 2 in lines 1–14 except where Smith has noted a variant. Because Or. Dr. 1 no. 33 shows ex. 4 mostly preserved, with every line preserved, an ellipsis (...) appears for each line of that exemplar in the score.

Like two of the bulls lining the façade of Court H (Bulls/Slabs 3 and 12), the inscription on this colossus, possibly a human-headed winged bull ( aladlammu ), began between the hind legs and concluded beneath the belly. Since only a small portion of the summary of campaigns (the second and third campaigns) is extant, late 695 to late 694 or early 693 is suggested here as the text’s date of composition.

Presumably, like text nos. 39 and 44, the entire inscription was written on a single colossus; note that the only colossi in Sennacherib’s palace whose inscriptions begin between the hind legs are those inscribed with an entire text. The original location of the colossus in the South-West Palace is not known. The extant text duplicates text no. 42 lines 7–10 and text no. 44 lines 16–21, but with one variant line 3'.

This 164-line inscription, which is the longest extant bull inscription of Sennacherib, is known from the originals and H.C. Rawlinson’s published copy; the four inscribed surfaces of the colossi were cut off and sent to the British Museum (London). The military narration includes accounts of six campaigns: (1) against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and his Chaldean and Elamite allies in Babylonia; (2) against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi; (3) to the Levant, against an Egyptian-led coalition that had been organized by the nobles and citizens of the city Ekron, and against the Judean king Hezekiah; (4) against Bīt-Yakīn; (5) to Mount Nipur and against Maniye, the king of the city Ukku; and (6) against the Chaldeans living in Elam. The account of the sixth campaign in this bull inscription is the longest and earliest attested report of those events and it records in detail how Sennacherib used well-trained sailors from Tyre, Sidon, and Cyprus (or Ionia) and Syrian ships to sail down the Tigris and across the Gulf. Like all the texts on Sennacherib’s other gateway colossi, this one is not dated. The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the first part of his sixth campaign, which took place in 694 (Sennacherib’s 11th regnal year), and thus the approximate date of composition is late 694 to early 693; the colossi with this text appear to have been inscribed shortly after those with text no. 44. This inscription is G. Smith’s “Bull 4” (G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3–4, 32–34, 43–67, 85 and 89–98).

The inscription began under the belly of the first bull (lines 1–46), continued between its hind legs (lines 47–85), between the hind legs of the second bull (lines 86–121), and then concluded under its belly (lines 122–164). A.H. Layard unearthed “the great bulls forming the centre portal of the grand entrance” (Discoveries p. 138; = Court H, Door  a , Bull 6 and Bull 7) and stated that they were inscribed with 152 (error for 164) lines of text; for the state of preservation of Bull 7 at the time of its discovery, see Or. Dr. 2 no. 49b (J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 66 pl. 16). Layard appears not to have copied the inscription before leaving Nineveh since no facsimiles have been found in his notebooks (MS A, MS B, MS C, and MS D). A partial squeeze of one of the surfaces was once in the British Museum (Galter et al., ARRIM 4 [1986] p. 28 no. 1) and this probably indicates that Layard had squeezes made of the text, making it not necessary for him to copy them. In 1854, three years after leaving Nineveh, Layard wanted the Court H, Door  a  bulls for the British Museum, and requested that Rawlinson, who was then supervising the Museum’s excavations in “Assyria,” remove them and send them to London. In a letter dated to May 13th, 1854, Rawlinson complains to Sir H. Ellis, Principal Librarian (Director) of the British Museum, about this request. Rawlinson complied with it, but in order to lighten his load, he sawed off the four inscribed slabs, in the process destroying the uninscribed, sculptured parts of the colossi and leaving only the bases. For photographs of the in situ remains, see J.M. Russell, Final Sack p. 65 pls. 14–15 and p. 216 fig. 30. The four inscribed surfaces made their way to London, where they were displayed in the British Museum. BM 118815a–b (formerly BM 819) is the surface under the belly of the first bull (Bull 6), BM 118821 (formerly BM 817) is the surface between the hind legs of that bull, BM 118819 (formerly BM 821) is the surface between the hind legs of the second bull (Bull 7), and BM 118817 (formerly BM 823) is the surface under the belly of that second colossus; note also that the surface under the belly of the first bull (BM 118815a–b) was cut in half. The base of Bull 6 measures 652 cm in length; the inscribed surface of that colossus (BM 118815a–b + BM 118821) is 453 cm long.   With regard to the provenance of the bulls in the nineteenth century records and publications, the heading in 3 R (pl. 12) refers to them as “the Kouyunjik Bulls.” In a letter dated December 1st, 1854, Rawlinson refers to them as “the large bulls at the grand entrance,” while an original British Museum inventory describes the slabs as “from Bull on E. side of the Grand Entrance of the South Palace” and “Do. Do. from Bull on W. Side.” From the in situ remains, it is certain that the four slabs now in the British Museum originate from Court H, Door  a  of the South-West Palace. Furthermore, a comparison of the lineation and text of these inscribed slabs (and the fuller text in 3 R) with G. Smith, Senn. pp. 3–4, 32–34, 43–67, 85 and 89–98 shows that this inscription is Smith’s “Bull 4.”   The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the first part of Sennacherib’s sixth campaign, which took place in 694, and thus the approximate date of composition is ca. late 694–early 693, as suggested by E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 118 and 123); note that L. Levine (JCS 34 [1982] pp. 41–48) proposes that the text dates to mid- to late 694 on the grounds that the inscription describes only the first phase of the sixth campaign and so it must have been composed while that military expedition was still in progress. Based on the contents of the building report, the Court H, Door  a  bulls appear to have been inscribed with this text shortly after the Room I, Door  c  bulls were inscribed with text no. 43 and the Court H façade bulls were inscribed with text no. 44. See the commentary to text no. 43 for further information.   The slabs are so badly worn that in many places the readings are very uncertain. To put a question mark in each of these places would make the transliteration very difficult to follow. The copy in 3 R generally shows much more text than is now preserved. Frahm collated the originals and noted numerous passages where the copy in 3 R is erroneous. Both authors also collated the originals and most of their readings agree with those of Frahm. The reports of Sennacherib’s first five campaigns are abbreviated versions of the accounts known from earlier inscriptions written on clay prisms; compare lines 3b–47 to text no. 16 i 27–v 32 and text no. 17 i 22–iv 60. This version of the account of the first part of the sixth campaign is not otherwise attested in the extant Sennacherib corpus, except for a few lines which are preserved on a clay prism fragment (text no. 20). Compare, for example, the later annalistic account of this event in text no. 22 iv 32–53. The concluding passage of the military narration (lines 102b–106a), which records the number of archers and shield bearers added to Sennacherib’s army, also duplicates material from earlier prism inscriptions, but with deviation in the numbers; cf. text no. 16 v 33–40 and text no. 17 v 15–22. The building report and concluding formulae duplicate (with some variation) those sections of  earlier prism, bull, and lion inscriptions. Compare lines 106b–164 to text no. 17 v 56b–vii 57 and viii 46–76, text no. 42 lines 13b–56', text no. 43 lines 7b–106, and text no. 44 lines 33b–73. Restorations are based on those texts.

The fragment, which is now in a private collection in Vienna, orginates from the inscribed surface under the belly of the colossus. Like two of the bulls lining the façade of Court H (Bulls/Slabs 1 and 10), the inscription on this colossus, possibly a human-headed winged bull, began under the belly and concluded between the hind legs. Since only a small portion of the building report is extant, late 695 to late 694 or early 693 is suggested here as the text’s date of composition. This piece is sometimes referred to in earlier editions and studies as the “Austrian Bull.”    Access  Sennacherib 47  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003521/]    Source:    AfO 35 p. 35 fig. 7  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P466656/]  (Vienna, Private collection)    Commentary   The original location of the colossus in the South-West Palace is not known and the fragment is presumed to have come from a human-headed winged bull, rather than a sphinx; see, for example, Frahm, Sanherib p. 119 and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 281. Based on the lineation, it is certain that the fragment originates from under the creature’s belly. Based on comparison with the inscriptions on other bulls and lions, the piece is either part of the first inscribed surface on the colossus, just like text no. 44 exs. 3–4, or part of the fourth and final inscribed surface of a pair of colossi, just like text no. 46. Because the width of each line is approximately the same as text no. 44 exs. 1 and 3, it seems more likely that the fragment originates from the first inscribed surface on the colossus and, therefore, the entire inscription was written on a single colossus (like text nos. 39 and 44), rather than on a pair of colossi. The extant text duplicates, with some variation in line 5', text no. 44 lines 50–54 (and text no. 46 lines 133–138). The restorations are based on text no. 44.

Because no copy, transliteration, or photograph of this lion inscription is known, no edition is provided here.

Galter, L. Levine, and J. Reade (ARRIM 4 [1986] p. 31 no. 12) tentatively suggest that the “nearly illegible” inscription on the sphinxes in Court XIX, Door  a  could be a text copied by Layard on MS C fol. 58r, an inscription on “a fragment on part of a yellow bull at entrance.” This proposed identification is unlikely since the colossi in that door of the South-West Palace are reported to have been sphinxes and since MS C fol. 58r appears to be a field copy of a bull inscription of Sennacherib’s father Sargon II; lines 1'–6', as already pointed out by E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 122–123), parallel Fuchs, Khorsabad pp. 69–70 and 305–306 Steirkolossen lines 71–78. Therefore, the identification of the Court XIX, Door  a  colossi as the text copied on MS C fol. 58r by Layard must be rejected.

The colossi were first discovered by L.W. King during his 1903–4 excavations of the northeastern end of the palace (Sennacherib’s Eastern Building) and re-excavated by J.M. Russell in 1989–90 as part of D. Stronach’s Nineveh Project. The text is only known from King’s unpublished field copies and R.C. Thompson’s published copies. Because most of the inscribed pieces are small and because sections of the preserved text are not duplicated in other (bull and lion) inscriptions of Sennacherib, reconstruction of the text is problematic. The prologue more or less duplicates that of text no. 43, while the building report utilizes material from earlier bull inscriptions (especially text nos. 44 and 46). The series  abnu šikinšu  (the so-called “stone description book”) was consulted in order to provide descriptions of various stones used in the construction of the palace. Despite the fact that the text is badly damaged, it is certain that it is one of the latest known bull inscriptions from the South-West Palace. It was likely composed ca. 693–691; the latter date is based on Sennacherib’s boast in text no. 22 (vi 36b–37), a copy of which is dated to 20-XII-691, that his palace had been completed.

Russell)    Commentary   In 1903–4, King discovered a poorly preserved building on the east side of the Kuyunjik mound, ca. 300 m northeast of Sennacherib’s throne room; this building came to be called the Eastern Building. The most notable feature of the building was a monumental gate flanked by inscribed bull colossi. King copied a number of the inscribed fragments, but never published them; these copies are in his “Kuyunjik: Notes on Sculptures and Inscriptions” notebook, which is found in the Department of the Middle East at the British Museum. Thompson (Arch. 79 [1929] pl. LII nos. 122M and 122N) later published copies of two of the fragments, not realizing that the two pieces joined; the join between the fragments was recognized by Russell. In 1989, Russell re-excavated Sennacherib’s Eastern Building and recovered seven fragments, some of which King had already copied. Nine additional fragments of the bulls from the Eastern Building have been identified among the copies in King’s notebook. Most belong to this text, but some are too small to be of use (and are therefore not incorporated into this edition); two of the fragments are part of another inscription of Sennacherib (see text no. 50). The fragments edited here may come from two or more bulls with the same inscription. Russell’s proposed join between Thompson, Arch. 79 (1929) pl. LII nos. 122M and 122N is not entirely certain; these pieces could come from different bulls. Note that one or both fragments could also join King, Notebook p. 3 no. 2 (text no. 50).   Like text nos. 40–43, 46, and 50, this text was inscribed on two colossi. The inscription began under the belly of the first bull (lines 1–29), continued between the hind legs of that colossus (lines 1'–17'), between the hind legs of the second bull (lines 1''–7''), and then concluded under the belly of that second colossus (lines 1'''–3''' and 1''''–6''''). Lines 1–7a duplicate text no. 43 lines 1–6a and text no. 50 lines 1–7a; lines 11b–16a duplicate, with some variation, text no. 50 lines 11b–16a; lines 23b–28 duplicate, with some variation, text no. 44 lines 43–47 and text no. 46 lines 125b–130;  lines 16'b–17' and 1''–7'' duplicate, with some variation, text no. 44 lines 52 and 54b–56 and text no. 46 lines 135 and 137b–139a; and lines 5''''b–6'''' duplicate text no. 44 lines 72b–73 and text no. 46 line 164b.

Lines 1'–16'a are an expanded version of text no. 44 lines 50–52a and text no. 46 lines 133b–135a; the descriptions of the various stones used in the construction of the palace are from the series  abnu šikinšu  (Schuster-Brandis, AOAT 46 pp. 24–47). Lines 1'''–3''' probably correspond to text no. 44 lines 63b–66a and text no. 46 lines 148b–150a.

This fragmentary inscription comes from a third colossus discovered on the east side of the Kuyunjik mound, ca. 300 m northeast of Sennacherib’s throne room; it is similar to text no. 49, which is inscribed on the other colossi flanking gateways in the northeastern part of Sennacherib’s palace. The text is formed by two fragments now joined together. Lines 1–19 were inscribed on the surface under the belly of the bull (the first of a pair of colossi) and lines 1'–11' were inscribed between the hind legs of that same colossus. Based on comparisons with the other bull and lion inscriptions, the text began under the belly of this bull, continued between its hind legs, between the hind legs of a second bull (now lost), and then concluded under the belly of that second colossus. It is not impossible that the fragments belong to the same bull as the two bull fragments copied by R.C. Thompson on Arch. 79 (1929) pl. LII (nos. 122M and 122N); see the commentary to text no. 49 for further details. Because no join can be confirmed with certainty, those fragments have been tentatively edited with text no. 49.

Dr. 6 no. 25b  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P466684/]    Commentary   This epigraph may be the caption that A.H. Layard describes as follows: “over one of the castles could be traced a few letters, giving no clue, however, to its name or site” (Discoveries p. 342); a rough copy by him is found in his MS C (fol. 11r). The drawing of the slab gives the impression that the epigraph comprises two lines of text, of which only the first sign was copied. The preserved signs, if the text shown on Or. Dr. 6 no. 25b and Layard, MS C fol. 11r are in fact the same inscription, are URU É DIŠ IB ?  DI ?  (Layard, MS C fol. 11r). One could tentatively read these signs as URU.É- ku-ba -[ at-ti  ...], “The city Bīt-Kuba[tti ...].” If this proposed reading is correct, then this text may be a duplicate of text no. 56 (Layard, MS C fol. 57v), a two-line caption recording the capture and looting of the city Bīt-Kubatti. J.M. Russell, however, suggests reading the preserved signs of the caption copied in Layard, MS C (fol. 11r) as URU.É- m ib / lu -[...]. Moreover, J. Jeffers (Iraq 73 [2011] pp. 87–116) has convincingly argued that the reliefs in Room XXXVIII (as well as those in Room XLVIII) depict images of Sennacherib’s fifth campaign and, therefore, the partially copied epigraph drawn on Or. Dr. 6 no. 25b should refer to a city that was conquered and destroyed during that campaign. Sennacherib states in several of his inscriptions (for example, text no. 22 iv 26b–31) that he conquered and burned thirty-three cities in the vicinty of the city Ukku, Maniye’s capital, and thus this epigraph could refer to any one of those cities. Following Jeffers’ suggestion that the Room XXXVIII reliefs depict images of the fifth campaign, this inscription and text no. 56 are edited separately since this epigraph probably records the conquest of a city near Ukku, and not Bīt-Kubatti, whose capture and destruction is recorded in an epigraph in Room LX.

Layard discovered fragments of three sculpted orthostats that had epigraphs. The Rev. E. Hincks provided a translation for one of these texts, which Layard then published in a popular account of his explorations of the Assyrian ruins at Nineveh (Discoveries p. 118). Hincks’ translation reads: “Sennacherib, king of Assyria ... (some object, the nature not ascertained) of wood, which from the Tigris I caused to be brought up ( through ?) the Kharri, or Khasri, on sledges (or boats), I caused to be carried (or to mount).” It is clear, as J. Reade has pointed out, that this epigraph is describing a scene showing wooden objects being carried by raft from the Tigris up the Ḫusur river; from there, they were hauled up to the palace on sleds. Recently, J.M. Russell identified a copy of this epigraph in Layard, MS D (p. 17); an unpublished transliteration of Hincks submitted in a report to the British Museum in May 1854 (Add. MS 22097) aided in the identification of the inscription.

When he re-excavated the throne room suite in the late 1960s, T. Madhloom revealed that Room I, Door  a  and Room V, Door  a  were decorated with thresholds with floral decoration, but he did not report that they were inscribed. However, the label in Boutcher’s notebook, “From centre of pavement slab between the large bulls at the Grand Entrance.—Palace of Sennacherib.—Kouyunjik,” indicates that the threshold in Room I, Door  a  was in fact inscribed.

Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 127) suggests that this text was inscribed on the backs of most of the wall slabs and colossi decorating Sennacherib’s palace; it was also inscribed on the backs of slabs lining the armory (Nebi Yunus) and the so-called Eastern Building (which probably marks the eastern end of Sennacherib’s palace). A.H. Layard copied a duplicate text from the backs of the bull colossi stationed in Room I, Door  e  and the inscription on these bulls has been edited here as ex. 13; for the inscription written on the visible surface of the bull, see text no. 42.   The precise number of stone slabs with this inscription discovered over the years is unknown. In particular, with regard to exs. 5 and 10, H.C. Rawlinson and T.A. Madhloom do not record the number of slabs bearing this inscription; both exemplars comprise at least two slabs.   Russell (Writing on the Wall p. 127) regards the text inscribed on the back of the slabs discovered by Layard in Room XXXIII (Discoveries p. 459), which are described as containing Sennacherib’s “name and usual titles,” as the inscription published in 1 R pl. 7 no. VIII E and not as exemplars of this text. Following Russell’s careful assessment of Sennacherib’s inscribed material from Nineveh, the Room XXXIII slabs are not edited here, but as text no. 51 exs. 1 and 2.   The text on all of the known exemplars is identical, with the exception of ex. 5. According to 1 R pl. 6 no. VIII A, that exemplar has ŠÚ for  kiš-šá-ti  in line 2. It is not known if the original slabs actually contained this orthographic variant or if it is an error on the part of the modern copyist. Because there is only one known variant on just one exemplar, no score is provided on the CD-ROM.   Sennacherib’s standard “Palace Inscription” is shorter than those of Ashurnasirpal II and Sargon II that are written on the backs of slabs lining the rooms of those two kings’ palaces. Those inscriptions provide information about the king, his deeds, and the appearance of his magnificent royal residences, while this text is a mere label that names its builder and owner.

Nassouhi’s claim that the inscription on that slab is a duplicate of ex. 1. The master text is ex. 1 and no score is provided on the CD-ROM. Ex. 1 deviates from the previous text (text no. 81) in that it omits Sennacherib’s titles “great king” ( šarru rabû ) and “mighty king” ( šarru dannu ); cf. the following text (text no. 83), which omits the title “king of the world” ( šar kiššati ). The number of slabs having this the text of ex. 1 is not known; in 1 R, the text is described as “on slabs,” suggesting that more than one slab bore this text. R.C. Thompson discovered an inscribed fragment of limestone at Nineveh (ex. 2*) and it may be a duplicate of one of the better preserved texts on stone slabs. The present location of that object is not known, so it could not be collated. Since only parts of the first two lines are preserved, its attribution to this text is not certain.

Exs. 11, 13, and 16 are well-head bricks. Ex. 24 actually comprises several bricks that Scott and MacGinnis report seeing in situ on the southeastern side of the Nebi Yunus cemetery, where the wall is preserved up to six courses of bricks high, resting on a course of limestone blocks; the number of bricks there bearing this text is not recorded.   Exs. 1–4, 7–8, and 10 were acquired by C.J. Rich between 1810–1820 and purchased by the British Museum from Mrs. Rich in 1825. Objects in the R-collection (also 1825-5-3) come from many sites in Iraq, including Nineveh, but they are mostly unprovenanced, unless Rich recorded the relevant information in his memoirs. Ex. 19 was part of the Joseph Troll collection of the Museum für Völkerkunde (Vienna) until 1952, when it became part of the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Vienna); the brick is reported to have been purchased in Mosul. In 1850, courtesy of K. Bellino, G.F. Grotefend published a composite copy of this inscription from four complete and two fragmentary bricks; those bricks are probably in the R-collection of the British Museum (see Frahm, Sanherib p. 139).   The authors were able to collate exs. 27–29 from several unpublished photographs taken by D.R. Frayne in the Eşki Şark Eserleri Müzesi (Istanbul).   The text of “Sennacherib [brick] A” and that of “Sennacherib [brick] B” are identical and are therefore edited here as a single text. C.B.F. Walker (CBI p. 120 nos. 172–173) differentiated the two texts on the basis of two orthographic variants: “B” has (1) É.GAL instead of KUR at the beginning of line 1 and (2) KUR  aš-šur  for KUR AŠ at the end of line 2. Although there are some minor variants in this inscription, no score is provided on the CD-ROM. The aforementioned variants are listed at the back of the book.

Bellino, published a copy of this inscription in 1850 from six complete and two fragmentary bricks; those bricks are probably in the R-collection of the British Museum (see Frahm, Sanherib p. 139). Ex. 10 is recorded as coming from Nineveh; exs. 11–12 were discovered at Kilīzu (Qaṣr Šemāmok); ex. 14 was found at Besian (a town just north of Nineveh) by R.C. Thompson; and ex. 15 was discovered during the 1954 Nebi Yunus excavations. F. Sarre and E. Herzfeld (Archäologische Reise 2 [1920] pp. 312–313) mention an object bearing a text that may be a duplicate of this inscription, but that text is not included here since its contents are not known with any degree of certainty. In AAA 19, Thompson refers to one or two inscribed bricks of Sennacherib that are similar to ex. 13, but the brick(s) are not included here since the contents are not known. Contrary to D.D. Luckenbill and C.B.F. Walker, ex. 11 (Ass 19003) comes from Kilīzu, not Aššur. Exs. 19–21 and 2* were collated from photographs taken by D.R. Frayne in Istanbul at the Eşki Şark Eserleri Müzesi. The text is inscribed, not stamped, on one of the edges of each brick. All of the minor (orthographic) variants are listed at the back of the book. No score is provided on the CD-ROM.

Exs. 6–8 were acquired by C.J. Rich between 1810–1820 and purchased by the British Museum from Mrs. Rich in 1825; for details, see the commentary to text no. 88. Exs. 10 and 15–28 certainly come from Nineveh and ex. 13 was purchased at Tell Yarah. Ex. 27 actually comprises three different exemplars since R.C. Thompson gives three different find spots and a variant in line 2 (⸢LUGAL⸣ for [MAN]); two of the bricks come from Ashurnasirpal II’s Palace, Square D, and one comes from Square H of that building. H. Behrens (JCS 37 [1985] pp. 243 and 247) records that the five-line inscribed brick purchased by E.A. Speiser at Tell Yarah (BASOR 55 [1934] pp. 22–23) is UM 37-16-8. However, this is not the case; that brick comes from Tepe Gawra and bears a (illegible) stamped five-line inscription. The Sennacherib brick from Tell Yarah (ex. 13) could not be found in the collections of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania (2013). Ex. 31 is reported to have been in the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid in 1854. The authors have been unable to confirm that the brick seen by de Longpérier is still in that collection. The authors were able to collate ex. 32 from an unpublished photograph taken by D.R. Frayne in the Eşki Şark Eserleri Müzesi (Istanbul). There is no score on the CD-ROM, but a few orthographic variants are listed at the back of the book.

Ex. 2 is a well-head brick and was previously catalogued in the British Museum as BM 12082. The attribution of exs. 6–8 is not certain as the name of the recipient of the house is entirely broken away; nevertheless they are tentatively edited here as certain exemplars. In his dissertation, Kinscherf published two duplicates of this text (exs. 9–10), both bearing the Aššur excavation number Ass 16777, one of which is certainly wrong. The correct excavation number of ex. 10 is not known since that brick is attested only from an excavation photograph (from which Kinscherf made his copy); the object was probably left in the field. In addition, two badly damaged bricks preserve on their edges inscriptions of Sennacherib recording the construction of a building; the inscriptions could be collated from photographs taken by D.R. Frayne in the Eşki Şark Eserleri Müzesi (Istanbul). The inscribed surfaces are too badly damaged to determine with certainty the content of the inscriptions apart from the king’s name. One or both bricks could be exemplars of this inscription or of another brick inscription of Sennacherib that is inscribed in three lines on the edges of bricks. Those two bricks are edited here as exs. 1*–2*. The lineation follows ex. 1. There is no score of this inscription on the CD-ROM; however, a few orthographic variants are listed at the back of the book.

The small inscribed and polished stone was an audience gift from Karib-il, the king of Saba. This is the first of six beads presented to Sennacherib by that ruler (text nos. 103–108). These objects may have been intended to be part of a deposit placed in the foundations of the  akītu -house at Aššur and, therefore, were likely inscribed sometime after 689, when Sennacherib was working on that temple; see p. 15 for details.

In that text he is said to have sent precious stones and choice aromatics to Sennacherib, who had them placed in that temple’s foundations. Following a proposal of Hommel, H. von Wissmann (Sabaʾ 2 pp. 145–150), suggests that the Karib-il mentioned in Sennacherib’s inscriptions is the Sabaean ruler ( mukarrib ) Karib-il Watar I, who records his successes on the battlefield and his improvement of the water supply system in a long inscription discovered in the Almaqah temple in Ṣirwāh. K.A. Kitchen (Documentation for Ancient Arabia 1 pp. 106–111 and 242) rejects this proposal and suggests that this Karib-il is the Sabaean ruler Karib-il Hašikum.

However, H. Galter (ARRIM 5 [1987] p. 29) suggests that Dumetu should be identified with Dummutu, a city located on the Euphrates in the southern part of the kingdom of Bīt-Adini. This bead, as well as the other beads that state that they were taken as booty from Dumetu/Duma (text nos. 112–115), could not have been inscribed until after that city was captured and, therefore, were engaved ca. 690 (or slightly later, 689).

The text, which was probably copied during the reign of Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal (as suggested by a few orthographic peculiarities), is very unusual as it appears to name Sargon (II) (name restored) as Sennacherib’s father and lists that king’s titulary. The original inscription may have been written ca. 699 or later since Sennacherib calls himself “king of the four quarters (of the world)” and, therefore, the  terminus post quem  is probably Sennacherib’s 5th regnal year (700). The title  šar kibrāt erbettim  appears to have been first used as an epithet of this Assyrian king in text no. 5 (an inscription dated to the eponymy of Bēl-šarrāni; 699) and it is regularly included in his titulary thereafter.

Borger attributed this text to Sennacherib; those lines contain the very beginning of a report of the first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II and his allies). As E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 195) has already noted, BM 99178 was probably inscribed sometime after the reign of Sennacherib, during the reign of Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal, since the orthography is not typical of the inscriptions written during Sennacherib’s reign. For example, in rev. 3' one expects ŠU.II- ia , not ŠU.II- ía . Because this is a later copy and because Esarhaddon’s and Ashurbanipal’s scribes did not always faithfully reproduce Sennacherib’s inscriptions (see, for example, the on-page notes to text no. 136 rev. i' 18' and text no. 138 rev. ii' 21), it is not impossible that the mention of Sargon II as Sennacherib’s father in this text is an interpolation, that is, the scribe added information that was not included on the original he was copying.

The building report, as far as it is preserved, includes: (1) a report of work on the walls of Nineveh and its citadel; and (2) a passage stating that Sennacherib built a bridge opposite the Citadel Gate. Based on the extant sections of the building report, it is fairly certain that this text would have been inscribed on clay cylinders or clay prisms.

The extant text contains parts of Sennacherib’s second, third, and fourth campaigns; the prologue and the account of the first campaign are completely missing. Since the scribe accurately transmitted the lineation of the original inscription on to the tablet (but not always the orthography), it is certain that this text was originally written on clay cylinders; cf., for example, the lineation of this text with that of text no. 4 lines 19–58. Moreover, based on comparisons with other inscriptions of Sennacherib on clay cylinders, one can surmise that the complete tablet contained ca. 70–72 lines; about seventeen lines are missing from the obverse and thirteen lines from the reverse. Because there is not sufficient room for the inscription’s building report and concluding formulae, the second part of the inscription must have been written on another tablet. Thus, this tablet is the first of two. The original inscription, as suggested by the contents of the accounts of the third and fourth campaigns and the use of horizontal ruling lines, was composed in Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year (699).

Obv. 1–4 would have contained the prologue and obv. 5–17 would have had a report of the first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II). Regardless of whether DT 320 (text no. 141) belongs to the same tablet as K 2627+, the lacuna after rev. 23 would have contained an account of the fourth campaign, a longer and different version of events than the one known from several of Sennacherib’s Nineveh prisms; see below and compare, for example, text no. 17 iii 82–iv 17 and text no. 22 iii 50–74.   The account of the third campaign duplicates the report known from clay prisms (and other cylinders inscribed in 699), rather than the account included on cylinders inscribed in 700 (Sennacherib’s 5th regnal year); see the commentary to text no. 6 and compare obv. 15'–rev. 21 of this text to text no. 4 lines 32–58 and text no. 22 ii 37–iii 49. See the on-page notes for the editorial changes that took place between 700 and 699.   Reports of the fourth campaign (against Bīt-Yakīn) first appear in inscriptions composed during Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year (699). Despite the fragmentary nature of the extant inscriptions that were written in 699, it is certain that the earliest versions of that military campaign differ significantly from the so-called “canonical” version that was included in inscriptions composed between 697 and 689 (or later). Rev. 22–23, the first two lines of the report of the fourth campaign, are not duplicated elsewhere in the known Sennacherib corpus. As already pointed out by E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 200), text no. 6 line 15' probably contains the same opening line of this military account as this text (rev. 22); the two texts are not sufficiently preserved to be able to see how their contents relate. The contents of DT 320 (text no. 141), which preserves parts of the final seven lines of a report of the fourth campaign, likewise differ significantly from the “canonical” version. The version of the fourth campaign in DT 320, and probably also in the other texts written in 699, did not end with a statement about Sennacherib placing Aššur-nādin-šumi on the throne of Babylon, but rather with a statement about confining his enemies in the swamps in southern Babylonia. Compare text no. 141 lines 4'–7' to text no. 22 iii 64–74.   There is some evidence that K 2627+ is a later, archival copy, perhaps inscribed in the reign of Ashurbanipal (or Esarhaddon). Apart from several unusual spellings of words (for which see the on-page notes), the scribe frequently uses the ÍA-sign for writing the first person possessive suffix  ya  (for example, obv. 2', 18', rev. 3, 5, and 12) and uses the ŠÁ-sign almost exclusively for the relative-determinative  ša . Apart from the writing of the name Karduniaš (KUR. kár-dun-ía-áš ), Sennacherib’s scribes do not use the ÍA-sign. The use of the ŠA-sign for the relative-determinative  ša  is more far common than that of the ŠÁ-sign; in the texts edited in Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/1, the relative-determinative  ša  is written with the ŠÁ-sign only ca. 12 percent of the time.   The extant text duplicates (with some variation) such other inscriptions as text no. 4 lines 19–58; text no. 16 ii 11–iv 37; and text no. 22 i 68–iii 49. The restorations are generally based on text no. 4, but for rev. 19–21 they come from  text no. 22.

What is preserved of the report of the fourth campaign deviates significantly from the “canonical” version that was inscribed on prisms (cf., for example, text no. 22 iii 50–74). The complete inscription likely also included accounts of the first, second, and third campaigns, as well as a report of building in Nineveh (see the introduction and commentary to text no. 140). The original text, as suggested by the contents of the account of the fourth campaign, was likely inscribed on clay cylinders during Sennacherib’s 6th regnal year (699), just like text nos. 5–8, and this tablet may be inscribed with a later, archival copy of one of those texts or a hitherto unknown inscription.

Assuming DT 320 and K 2627+ both come from the same object, then it is very unlikely, as E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 201) has already pointed out, that line 10' is the first line of the text’s building report, as there is not sufficient room on the tablet (ca. 5 lines); that line may preserve traces of a scribal note (“Abschriftvermerk”). Should DT 320 not belong to the same tablet as K 2627+, then line 10' could contain the first line of a building report.

That report, as far as it is preserved, appears to duplicate the account that was written on clay cylinders during Sennacherib’s 5th regnal year (700). The tablet, of which only a small portion is preserved, probably included a copy of an entire inscription of Sennacherib, possibly text no. 4 (or one of the texts written on cylinders in 699, text nos. 5–8). Thus, the complete text likely comprised a short prologue, accounts of Sennacherib’s first three campaigns, a short concluding statement about the formation of a large military contingent, an account of building at Nineveh, and concluding formulae.

As E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 202) has already pointed out, the report of the third campaign, as far as it is preserved, is a copy of text no. 4, a text inscribed on clay cylinders during the year 700, or of one of the texts written on clay cylinders in the year 699, text nos. 5–8. The evidence is twofold: (1) each line of those cylinder inscriptions is consistently copied in two lines on this tablet; and (2) rev. 5 begins with  ša   m ḫa-za-qi-ia -⸢ ú ⸣ “of Hezekiah,” instead of   ù   m ḫa-za-qi-ia -⸢ ú ⸣, “moreover, Hezekiah.” With regard to the use of  ša  before the name of Hezekiah, that word combination in this passage only appears in the earliest accounts of the third campaign, for example, text no. 4 (line 49); in later accounts of the third campaign, in text no. 15 (iv 6) for example,  ù  replaces  ša . With regard to the lineation, it is fairly certain that the scribe had a cylinder in front of him when he was writing out this tablet.  Since most lines on cylinders are fairly long, the scribe copied the contents of those lines in two lines; for example, text no. 4 line 38 = obv. 2'–3', line 39 = obv. 4'–5', and line 40 = obv. 6'–7'. However, with regard to shorter lines on the cylinder, those lines were copied in a single line on this tablet; for example, text no. 4 line 49 = rev. 5. Moreover, the beginning of each line of the cylinder is faithfully transferred to the tablet copy; for example, text no. 4 line 47 and rev. 1 of this text both begin with DUMU.MEŠ, and text no. 4 line 48 and rev. 3 of this text both start with  m pa-di-i . Based on this evidence, Frahm conjectured that the obverse and reverse each had approximately ninety-two lines of text. Assuming that BM 134496 + BM 134600 contains a copy of text no. 4, Frahm suggests that lines 1–46 of that text were copied on the obverse and that lines 47–94 were copied on the reverse. This may be true, but one cannot be certain that this copy is not of another inscription composed in Sennacherib’s 5th (700) or 6th (699) regnal years. However, this tablet, unlike the one inscribed with text nos. 140–141, most likely was inscribed with a complete text. The extant text duplicates text no. 4 lines 37–51 and the restorations are based on that text.

The extant text contains abbreviated reports of his third, fifth, and sixth campaigns, as well as short accounts of the campaigns that took place in the eponymies of Šulmu-Bēl (696) and Aššur-bēlu-uṣur (695). As far as it is preserved, the inscription is similar to one written on a six-sided clay prism (text no. 26) and two inscriptions written on stone tablets (text nos. 34–35).

If K 2655 + K 2800 + Sm 318 belongs to the same tablet as K 4507 (text no. 143) and Bu 89-4-26,150 (text no. 144), then the Sennacherib inscription on the obverse immediately follows text no. 144 col. i. Col. i of the tablet ends with text no. 144 i 8' and col. ii of the tablet begins with col. i' 1 of this text, thus providing supporting evidence that K 2655+ and Bu 89-4-26,150 could come from one and the same tablet. The script and the length of the lines of both fragments are very similar, as already noted by E. Frahm. Moreover, text no. 143 ii 1'–4' could preserve the beginning of col. i' 8'–11' of this text and, therefore, both K 2655+ and K 4507 could belong to the same object. For further details, see Figure 17 on p. 191 and Frahm, Sanherib pp. 203–204. The extant text of col. i' duplicates (with some variation), for example, text no. 22 v 63b–75, vi 7b–19a and 27b–32a; and text no 230 lines 60–66a, 90b–97a, and 101b–106.

The first epigraph (lines 1–9) describes a wild, mountainous terrain through which Sennacherib passed with his troops, and probably refers to the second campaign (702). This conclusion is confirmed by the second epigraph (line 10) which simply says “Bīt-Kubat,” one of the places Sennacherib reached on that expedition. The third epigraph (lines 11–13) describes the flight of Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) from Babylon to escape Sennacherib’s army, presumably on the first campaign (703). The fourth epigraph (lines 14–17) describes Šūzubu falling from his horse out of fear of Sennacherib’s attack. Both Nergal-ušēzib and Mušēzib-Marduk were called Šūzubu in Sennacherib’s inscriptions and it is unknown which one this is. The last two epigraphs (lines 18 and 19) are simply labels for the lands Sumer and Meluḫḫa.

Nine lines are written on the obverse (lines 1–9), one line on the bottom edge (line 10), and nine lines on the reverse (lines 11–19). The script is generally Neo-Assyrian, but there are a few Babylonian sign forms; these are  tu  ( bir-tu-uš-šu-nu ) in line 5 and the LUGAL-signs in lines 11 and 14 (LUGAL- ut ). The first epigraph (lines 1–9) is written in Neo-Assyrian, rather than in Standard Babylonian. Note the Assyrian subordinate marker in lines 3 and 4 ( la-áš-šu-ni  and  še-ru-ʾu-ú-ni  respectively) and the  ss  for  št  in line 8 ( ú-sa-am-ri-iṣ ). Because Neo-Assyrian is not used for epigraphs on Sargonid palace reliefs, Frahm questions whether this text was meant for another object with images. As for the date the tablet was inscribed, this is not known, especially since it is not certain to which Babylonian king Šūzubu is referring in the fourth epigraph (lines 14–17), Nergal-ušēzib or Mušēzib-Marduk. If it is the latter, then the earliest possible date is the year 693.

The second epigraph (lines 2–4), which is similiar to text no. 149 lines 11–13, describes the flight of the Babylonian ruler Marduk-apla-iddina II from Babylon to escape Sennacherib’s army, presumably during the first campaign (703).  Although it is not sufficiently preserved for us to be certain of its contents, the third epigraph (lines 5–8) describes a joyous event in which the Assyrian king participated.

The script is Neo-Assyrian but interspersed with Neo-Babylonian sign forms, a characteristic of Assyrian inscriptions on stone. The date the tablet was inscribed is not known. Borger suggests that the tablet was probably written after Sennacherib’s first campaign (703–702), but Frahm is less certain of the date since the third epigraph (lines 5–8) may refer to an event that took place in the year 703 or the year 700, depending on whether it refers to the appointment of Bēl-ibni or Aššur-nādin-šumi as king in Babylon.

This tablet, which may have been part of a series, contains only the building report, or most of it. The extant text, which duplicates the contents of the building report of an inscription written on clay prisms during Sennacherib’s 8th regnal year (697), contains parts of a description of the rebuilding of Egalzagdinutukua and a passage recording the construction of the wall Badnigalbilukurašušu and its (fourteen) gates. Based on similarities with text no. 15, the inscription copied on this tablet was probably composed in the year 697 (or possibly one year earlier, 698).

The tablet probably had two columns on each side; see also Frahm, Sanherib p. 213. It is not certain if this tablet contains a draft or an archival copy of the building report of text no. 15 (or most of that part of the text) or of another inscription written on clay prisms ca. 698–697. Based on the conjectured number of lines missing between obv. i' 12 and rev. i 1', which can be estimated from the building report of text no. 15, E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 213) suggests that (1) each column had ca. 63 lines and that (2) ca. 103 lines are missing between the extant sections of the obverse and reverse. If this proves correct, then col. i (completely missing) would have contained text no. 15 v 18–vi 11 and the lacuna between obv. i' (= col. ii) 12 and rev. i (= col. iii) 1' would have had vi 24b–vii 7' of that text. As for the contents of col. iv (completely missing), it is not entirely certain that the scribe could have inscribed all of text no. 15 vii 21'–viii 28'' in ca. 63 lines. Whatever did not fit was probably inscribed on another tablet. Of course, one cannot rule out the possibility that the building report copied on this tablet was shorter than that of text no. 15. The extant text duplicates text no. 15 vi 12–24a and vii 8'–20'. The restorations are based on that text.

Frahm (Sanherib pp. 215–217 T 179) (1) obv. 25 of this text is followed by text no. 154 obv. 1' after a lacuna of undetermined length and (2) rev. 1' of this text follows text no. 154 rev. 7' after a sizeable lacuna. The invocation of gods (beginning with Aššur and ending with the Sebetti), is not paralleled verbatim in the Sennacherib (or in the late Neo-Assyrian) corpus, but the text on the reverse, which describes the erection of steles after completing work on a system of canals and which contains the concluding formulae, duplicates (with some deviation) text no. 223 lines 55–60. Because that section of text duplicates material presently known only from inscriptions of Sennacherib inscribed on a cliff face at Ḫinnis-Bavian, E. Weissert (Frahm, Sanherib p. 215) identifies the text written on K 100 as belonging to the Sennacherib corpus; E. Frahm agrees with this assessment. Following R. Borger (Asarh. p. 115 §85), G.W. Vera Chamaza (Omnipotenz pp. 488–490) still thinks that this is a text of Esarhaddon.

It was originally the seal of Šagarakti-Šuriaš, king of Babylonia, but Tukultī-Ninurta I seized it as booty during his conquest of Babylonia and had an inscription of his own added to the object.

Only the concluding formulae of the first text (Inscription A) is extant, while parts of all twenty-six lines of the second text (Inscription B) are preserved. The latter text, which is separated from the former by a horizontal ruling and written in a high literary style, describes the Tablet of Destinies and representations of the god Aššur and Sennacherib. Although Inscription B provides a wealth of information about Sennacherib’s theological reforms, the precise context of the text is uncertain. The inscriptions were composed relatively late in Sennacherib’s reign (post-689).    Access  Sennacherib 158  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q003963/]    Source:    K 06177 + K 08869  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P238626/]    Commentary   Parts of the obverse, reverse, bottom edge, left edge, and right edge are preserved. K 6177 + K 8869 is not a regular, finished tablet and the script is contemporary Babylonian, something unique for an inscription of this Assyrian king. The inscriptions written on this tablet are (first) drafts, or possibly later copies. With regard to the script, A.R. George (Iraq 48 [1986] p. 137) suggests that a Babylonian scribe was employed because southern scholars were better qualified to compose a text in high literary Standard Babylonian. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 220) further postulates that Sennacherib had Babylonian priests brought to Assyria since they had the theological know-how to properly transfer Marduk’s attributes to Aššur and that one of those priests was the scribe of this text. The purpose and context of the inscriptions are uncertain, due in part to the fact that the subscript (assuming the tablet had one on the reverse) is completely broken away. Because Inscription B (obv. 5'–rev. 11), the better preserved of the two inscriptions, is descriptive, rather than narrative, George (Iraq 48 [1986] pp. 133–144) proposes that that inscription is an extended epigraph, with appended concluding formulae, which was written on a now-lost (or never finished) monument. Regarding Inscription A (obv. 1'–4'), he notes that too little of it is preserved to be certain if that text is a second inscription on the same monument or if it was written on a completely different object. Moreover, George postulates that the images of Aššur and Sennacherib described in Inscription B were transposed onto the Tablet of Destinies, which is also described in this text, by Aššur’s seal, the Seal of Destinies (Seal A of the Esarhaddon Vassal Treaties; see text no. 212 for further details), and, therefore, that text describes the Tablet of Destinies, a clay tablet sealed by the Seal of Destinies; for example, the tablets upon which Esarhaddon had his Vassal Treaties (Parpola and Watanabe, SAA 2 pp. 22–58 nos. 4–6) written were such tablets. Frahm (Sanherib p. 221) suggests that Inscription B (and possibly also Inscription A) may have been written on a metal object that also depicted the Tablet of Destinies, the god Aššur, and Sennacherib. He conjectures that such an object might have been (the plating on) the Dais of Destinies ( parak šīmāti ) in the Aššur temple at Aššur; Esarhaddon (Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 136 Esarhaddon 60 lines 26'–29'a) records that he reconstructed the Dais of Destinies entirely with  zaḫalû - and  ešmarû -metal. Given the absence of a subscript, George’s and Frahm’s interpretations must remain conjectural. A detailed discussion of this issue falls outside the scope of the present volume.

K 2411, the tablet inscribed with text no. 162, is likely a later copy of the contents of K 8664, with the addition of Ashurbanipal’s replacement inscription. Both tablets were probably inscribed around the same time (655 = Ashurbanipal’s 14th regnal year).

E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 226) proposes that K 8664 and K 2411 preserve parts of one and the same Sennacherib inscription; this text (K 8664) contains part of the dedication to Aššur and text no. 162 (K 2411) iii 1'–16' contain the end of the building report and the concluding formulae.

K 2411, which is probably from Nineveh, is a fragment of that tablet. The Sennacherib inscription began on the obverse and ended in the upper part of the first column on the reverse (iii 1'–16'). That text is followed by descriptions of the pleasure bed and throne of Babylon’s tutelary deity that Ashurbanipal had had recorded (iii 17'–35'), a five-line subscript noting why Ashurbanipal had this tablet written (iii 36'–40'), and the text of Ashurbanipal that replaced his grandfather’s texts on the furniture (iv 1'–29').

Furthermore, Craig did not copy or note the uninscribed 6.3 cm space at the end of col. iv; this fact has also not been mentioned in previous editions, translations, and studies. This omission has given rise to the misunderstanding that the texts on K 2411 copied by Craig in ABRT were all on the obverse (cols. i and ii). As already correctly recognized by M. Streck (Asb. pp. 292–303 no. 14) and D.D. Luckenbill (ARAB 2 pp. 387–390 §§1010–1018), this is not the case: Craig, ABRT 1 pp. 76–79 represent the reverse (cols. iii and iv) of K 2411. See Figure 22 on the next page.   This tablet may have been a copy of text no. 161, but with the new inscription of Ashurbanipal added. Contrary to B. Landsberger (Brief p. 25 n. 40), iii 1'–4' and iii 5'–16' are not parts of two different inscriptions; iii 1'–4' preserve the end of the building report and iii 5'–16' contain the concluding formulae. Based on the subscript of text no. 161 (rev. 9'–11'), E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 226) proposes that text no. 161 (K 8664) obv. 1–20 are the beginning of the inscription, the dedication to the god Aššur, and that this text (K 2411) iii 1'–16' are the end of the same inscription.

The copy is executed in monumental script (with the exception of line 6'), exactly as the inscription was to go on the original slabs; horizontal ruling lines separate every line of text, with the exception of lines 5'–6'. Only a small portion of the text is preserved; it contains several of Sennacherib’s epithets, a boast about the refurbishment of the image of the god Aššur and the  perfecting of the rites of Ešarra, and a reference to Sennacherib’s father, Sargon II. The text is reminiscent of the so-called “Sin of Sargon” text (see Tadmor, Landsberger, and Parpola, SAAB 3 [1989] pp. 3–52; and Livingstone SAA 3 pp. 77–79 no. 33). The reverse preserves only a four-line subscript, which is written in Neo-Assyrian and “normal (non-monumental) clay script,” stating that this inscription was written on  alallu -stone slabs that were intended for the king to stand upon.

Although the prism is complete, its entire surface is very  worn, making it impossible to read most of text inscribed upon it. The fifteen-line building report is sufficiently legible, however, to allow us to determine that that passage records the renovation of the innermost part of one of Aššur’s palaces, a royal residence worked on by Tiglath-pileser I (1114–1076) and Ashurnasirpal II (883–859); Sennacherib states that he regarded those kings’ work as being poorly done. After the construction came to a close, the god Aššur and the other gods of the city were invited inside for a festive celebration. Only the building report is edited here. Although the prism is not dated, its date of composition is ca. 691–689 — around the same time as text nos. 18 and 22–23 — since its  terminus post quem  is the battle of Ḫalulê (described in cols. vii–viii), which occurred during the king’s eighth campaign (691).

Accounts of the events of the king’s 9th and 10th regnal years (696 and 695), the campaigns undertaken by his officials to Ḫilakku (Cilicia) and the city Tīl-Garimme, however, are not included among the king’s victories on the battlefield. The line preceding the building report reads ⸢ šá ⸣  a-na  ⸢ nap ⸣- šá-te  ⸢ ú-ṣu-ú i-kaš -[ šá ]-⸢ du ú ⸣- ra-sa-bu ina  ⸢GIŠ⸣.[TUKUL] “they c[au]ght (the runaways among them) who had fled for (their) lives (and) killed (them) with the [sword]” the last line of the eighth campaign (see, for example, text no. 22 v 17–vi 35), and, therefore, it is assumed that the military narration of this text duplicates that of text nos. 22–23.   Since the introduction and military narration are poorly preserved and since these sections duplicate well-known texts, these parts of the inscription are not edited here. Only the building report, approximately the last quarter of col. viii, is included here. Note that the line count follows that of the building account, and not the line count of col. viii of the prism since it is no longer possible to accurately assign line numbers to the entire column due to the poor state preservation of that column’s surface; see also Frahm, KAL 3 pp. 84–86 no. 40.

Parts of the reports of the king’s first three campaigns and the final lines of the building report are preserved. The building report, which is not duplicated elsewhere in the known Sennacherib corpus, describes construction at Assyria’s principal cult center, but, because it is poorly preserved and difficult to read, its contents are uncertain. It appears, however, to mention the walls and gates of the city Aššur. Like text no. 164, the prism does not have a date written on it.

Most of the surface of this prism is very badly worn, just like the prism inscribed with text no. 164. The edition here does not include A 61 (Istanbul) since that piece was not available for study, neither from the original nor the excavation photo (Ass ph S 4955); the tentative, non-physical join between that fragment and VA 5061 + VA 5632a + VA 5632b + VA 7512 was suggested by E. Frahm (KAL 3 p. 33). Although the building report is badly damaged and difficult to read, it is certain that it is not duplicated elsewhere in the known Sennacherib corpus. Frahm notes that it mentions the walls and gates of the city Aššur. Unfortunately, the authors were unable to properly re-examine this passage, giving it the full treatment it deserves. Further collation could clarify the interpretation of this badly damaged, but unique, building report. As for the military narration, the extant passages duplicate, for example, text no. 16 i 34–70, ii 10–62, and iii 20–64. Restorations are based on that text.

This text is unusual for two reasons: (1) horizontal stone prisms with Assyrian royal inscriptions are not common, and (2) the text says nothing about the king’s military achievements, other than some general phrases among the epithets.

In many regards the object type has more in common with (barrel) cylinders than with prisms. Ex. 2 is fragmentarily preserved and the three fragments comprising that exemplar are known from Aššur excavation photographs, but with each piece photographed individually. L. Kinscherf copied Ass 17399 in his unpublished dissertation, O. Schroeder noted the (orthographic and paleographic) variants in Ass 18334 in his notes to the copy of Ass 18434 (ex. 1) in KAH 2 (no. 124), and Ass 18617 remains unpublished. The pieces are reported by O. Pedersén to be in the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), but they could not be found (May 2011). Therefore, Ass 17399 + Ass 18334 (+) ?  Ass 18617 were collated from the Aššur excavation photographs Ass ph 5179, S 6812, and S 6854.

Face i = lines 1–5, face ii = lines 6–10, face iii = lines 11–15, face iv = lines 16–20, face v = lines 21–25, face vi = lines 26–30, face vii = lines 31–35, and face viii = lines 36–39.

Of particular note is that people from Dilmun helped destroy Babylon; they may have assisted Sennacherib remove earth from that city and pile it up in the  akītu -house at Aššur. Thus, the inscription must date from after 689 since the  terminus post quem  can be established as the sack and destruction of Babylon, both of which took place late in Sennacherib’s 16th regnal year. It has been suggested by several scholars that this table may have been inscribed ca. 683 since the contents of its inscription are similar to those of a royal decree (Kataja and Whiting, SAA 12 pp. 104–108 no. 86) that also records work on the  akītu -house at Aššur, as well as the allocation of offerings; that document is dated to Sennacherib’s 22nd regnal year.

Weissbach (OLZ 37 [1934] col. 229) suggests that ex. 1 is an exemplar of the previous text (text no. 169) and stated that its final lines are completely broken away. The on-the-spot copy (“Fundkopie”) of Ass 3798a, whose inscription was later reproduced on Messerschmidt, KAH 1 p. 68* (no. 74), gives the impression that no lines are missing on the stone block. Its find spot and the orthography of  māt aššur  (KUR  aš-šur , rather than KUR AŠ) have more in common with Ass 3797a (text no. 169 ex. 1) and duplicates of that text than with Ass 10215, Ass 10216, and Ass 11722 (exs. 2–4 of this text). However, the lineation of Ass 3798a has more in common with Ass 10215 and Ass 10216 (exs. 2–3) than with Ass 3797a (text no. 169 ex. 1) and its duplicates. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 168) suggests that it is not impossible that Ass 3798a is a duplicate of text no. 169 and that the inscription was written on a series of two stone blocks, the second of which (the block containing the end of the text) is no longer preserved. Since the original was left at Aššur and no excavation photographs of ex. 1 are known, it is not certain if Ass 3798a is a duplicate of this text or of text no. 169. Therefore, Ass 3798a is provisionally edited here as a certain exemplar. Note that the inscription on ex. 4 is written in four, rather than three, lines. A score is presented on the CD-ROM.

The text of ex. 1 was written on six (or possibly eight) blocks, and that of ex. 3 was inscribed on four blocks. The total number of blocks used to inscribe the text on ex. 2 is not known. The blocks were left at Aššur. Ex. 1 and one block of ex. 3 could be collated from excavation photographs. Ass 10978a–c (ex. 2) is said to be a duplicate of this text, but this cannot be confirmed since no excavation photograph or on-the-spot copy (“Fundkopie”) is known. O. Pedersén (Katalog p. 13) tentatively suggests that Ass 10987, a block found south of Ass 10978a–c, may come from the same series of blocks as Ass 10978a–c; a “Fundkopie” was made for Ass 10987, but that copy was not available for study. Therefore, the contents of each line of that exemplar is indicated by an ellipsis (...) in the score on the CD-ROM. It is possible that ex. 3 is part of another inscription rather than a duplicate of ex. 1. This is based on the line arrangement and the fact that the text on the lower left block of that series begins with  u  DINGIR.MEŠ GAL.⸢MEŠ⸣ “and the (other) great gods.” Thus, the text inscribed on Ass 11054a–d (of which only one block is photographed) may have had a longer list of deities in the king’s epithet  ēpiš ṣalam  ..., “the one who fashioned image(s) of ...,” a list similar to those in text nos. 172 or 173. Without further evidence, it is uncertain if Ass 11054a–d bear a unique inscription or are inscribed with a text identical to the one written on Ass 10998a–d. Nevertheless, it is tentatively edited here as a duplicate of ex. 1. The master text is a conflation of exs. 1 and 3, but the lineation follows ex. 1.   There are several other stone blocks from Aššur inscribed with texts of Sennacherib recording the construction of the  akītu -house. Each of those blocks is part of a series of (four to nine) blocks that bear a single inscription and are only known from the Aššur excavation field journals. Since no on-the-spot copies or excavation photographs were made of these objects, nothing certain is known about the inscriptions writen on them. For the convenience of the reader these are listed in the catalogue of uncertain exemplars. It should be noted that many, or even all, of the exemplars are probably duplicates of text nos. 174–176. Some, however, could be inscribed with an otherwise unattested inscription.

Ass 11046a (with the beginnings of lines 1–4) is the best preserved of the nine blocks and its contents can be read with certainty.

Like those three texts, it mentions the goddess Bēlet-ilī and the god Ḫaya in the king’s epithet  ēpiš ṣalam  ... “the one who fashioned image(s) of ...” Although the building report is not preserved, the inscribed block shown on Ass ph 5031 was likely inscribed with a text recording the construction of the  akītu -house at Aššur. This text was written on a series of at least four stone blocks, only one of which is presently known; this block was discovered in a secondary usage, forming part of a Parthian period wall. The block, whose excavation number is not known, was left at Aššur and, therefore, the inscription was collated from the excavation photo.

In the case of exs. 1* and 2*, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether these blocks are inscribed with this text or text no. 182 since the relevant passage (the inclusion or omission of  ib-ba-nu-u ) is damaged. O. Pedersén (Katalog p. 10) reports that Ass 558 (ex. 2*) contains the same inscription as Ass 454 (text no. 183), but this is not the case as Ass 558 has  u  DINGIR.ME GAL.ME (line 3), whereas Ass 454 does not. Ass 454 is edited separately since it contains a major variant; see text no. 183 for details. As for exs. 3*–5*, there are no on-the-spot copies (“Fundkopien”) or excavation photographs of the inscriptions written on these stone blocks. Relying on excavation field journals, O. Pedersén (Katalog p. 10) lists Ass 311a (ex. 3*) as a duplicate of KAH 1 no. 43 (= Ass 282) and Ass 823 (ex. 4*) and Ass 824 (ex. 5*) as duplicates of Ass 282 (ex. 1 of this text). Since no information other than what is recorded in the Aššur field journals is known about these inscriptions, we are unable to verify the initial field identification and thus are not able to confirm whether Ass 311a (ex. 3*), Ass 823 (ex. 4*), and Ass 824 (ex. 5*) are exemplars of this text or text no. 182. Therefore, the contents of each line of those three exemplars are indicated by an ellipsis (...) in the score on the CD-ROM.   There are several other stone blocks from Aššur that are reported to be similar to Ass 282 (ex. 1 of this text) and other blocks with texts recording the construction of a house for Aššur-ilī-muballissu. Since no on-the-spot copies or excavation photographs were made of the objects, nothing specific is known about the inscriptions written on them. Some of these could be duplicates of text nos. 181–185, while others could be inscribed with an otherwise unattested inscription. For the convenience of the reader these are included in the catalogue of uncertain exemplars, as exs. 6*–25*.

A third exemplar, which was probably left at Aššur, is known from Ass ph 2222. Unlike text nos. 181–183, this inscription omits the reference to Aššur-ilī-muballissu being “in the service of (the god) Aššur” ( šá ina  GÌR.II AN.ŠÁR) or “who was created for the service of (the god) Aššur” ( šá ina  GÌR.II AN.ŠÁR  ib-ba-nu-u ).

Inscription 1 comprises eight small inscribed surfaces while Inscription 2 comprises six small and three medium-sized inscribed surfaces. Sennacherib’s name ([ md ]30-PAP.⸢MEŠ⸣-[SU]) and the epithet “the one who fashioned image(s)” (⸢DÙ⸣- ìš  ⸢ ṣa-lam ⸣) are the only parts of Inscription 1 that can be read with certainty. E. Frahm (Sanherib p. 167) points out that one could tentatively restore the name of the goddess Šerūa ([ d še ]- ru -[ u ]- a ) in line 2. Inscription 2 is marginally better preserved and, like Inscription 1, few words can be read with certainty. Part of the king’s name ([ m ]⸢ d ⸣[30-PAP.MEŠ-SU]) and his titles “king of the world” ([MAN] ŠÚ) and “king of Assyria” (⸢MAN⸣ KUR [ aš-šur ]) are preserved in line 1, and the names of several deities — Mullissu ( d NIN.[LÍL]), Sîn ([ d ]30), Anu ([ d a ]- nim ), and Ḫaya ([ d ]⸢ ḫa-ìa ⸣) — appear in lines 2–6. Since the pieces of neither text duplicate one another it is not possible to determine whether the two texts are identical or whether they are two separate inscriptions.

In addition to the text, there are two inverted numbers (comprising three cuneiform signs) incised just above line 1: 5 (written IA₇) and 26 (written 20+6).

The two pieces do not belong to the same object since AO 20185 dates to the reign of Esarhaddon (or Ashurbanipal) and IM 62197 comes from the time of Sennacherib.

Galter and E. Frahm say ex. 1 was discovered in area kA3III, while O. Pedersén (using Aššur excavation field journals) states that the provenance is iD3IV (on the brick terrace). The bricks were probably left at Aššur and, therefore, the exemplars were collated from an excavation photograph (Ass ph 5634). In addition to Ass 16409a–d, there are two unnumbered pieces photographed with these fragments; their excavation numbers and find spots are not known. All six certain exemplars are poorly preserved and the extant text is not always legible on the photograph. The inscription is written on the face of the bricks. The name of the structure in the Aššur temple is damaged in all exemplars (or not read with certainty from Ass ph 5634). Based on their provenance, some or all of these bricks may record work on the new courtyard that Sennacherib had constructed for Ešarra, and the inscription could be a near duplicate of a text written on stone blocks (text no. 169); Frahm suggests that the reference to white limestone would have been replaced by the mention of baked bricks. Moreover, due to the bricks’ poor state of preservation, we are uncertain if all six exemplars are inscribed with the same text. For convenience, all of the pieces photographed in Ass ph 5634 are edited together. The master text is a conflation of all six certain exemplars. In addition, Galter proposes that the inscription written on VA Ass 3282 could also be a near duplicate of text no. 169 and, therefore, a duplicate of this text. As Frahm has already pointed out, the text written on that brick is too fragmentarily preserved to be certain of what project at Aššur it records. Therefore, VA Ass 3282 is tentatively included here as an uncertain exemplar (ex. 1*). No score is provided on the CD-ROM and no minor variants are listed at the back of the book.

Ex. 4 has the inscription written on the edge of the brick. The text is usually written in five lines (exs. 1, 7, 9–12, and 21–22); in one exemplar (ex. 4), however, it is written in three lines. Exs. 2–3, 5–6, 9–10, 12–14, and 22 were probably left in the field. Exs. 9–10, 12–13, and 22 are known from excavation photographs and, therefore, could be collated; their measurements, however, could not be determined. Exs. 3 and 5–6 are known from on-the-spot copies (“Fundkopien”) and, therefore, could only be edited from the facsimiles of those bricks in the Aššur excavation field notes. There are no on-the-spot copies or excavation photographs of exs. 2 and 14. The assignation of those exemplars to this text is based on information in the field journals and, thus, exs. 2 and 14 are included here arbitrarily. Ex. 21 was collated from a photograph of the brick in Istanbul taken by D.R. Frayne for the RIM Project. The master line and the lineation of the edition follow ex. 1. There is no score of this text on the CD-ROM. However, the known orthographic variants are listed at the back of the book.

Ex. 1 was probably left at Aššur and is known from an on-the-spot copy (“Fundkopie”), which was later published  (Messerschmidt, KAH 1 p. 49* no. 47). Since that brick was not available for study, its inscription was not collated and, therefore, the transliteration is based on the published copy. Ex. 5 was probably also left in the field; no “Fundkopie” or excavation photograph was taken of the two brick fragments and, thus, the assignment of Ass 14343a–b to this text is based on information in the field notes from the Aššur eexcavations. Therefore, ex. 5 is arbitrarily included here as a certain exemplar. Ex. 6 was collated from a photograph of the brick in Istanbul taken by D.R. Frayne for the RIM Project. Ass 272 is cited in previous literature as being a duplicate of this text, but it is a duplicate of text no. 203 and edited there as ex. 3. E. Nassouhi (Guide Sommaire p. 17) mentions a brick inscription in Istanbul that could be a duplicate of this text or the previous text (text no. 203). The museum number is cited as EŞ 7864 + EŞ 6671, which is certainly wrong since EŞ 7864 is an irregular shaped gypsum block that preserves part of the epitaph of Ešarra-ḫammat, Esarhaddon’s wife; for an edition, see Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 314 Esarhaddon 2002. The correct number of the inscribed brick mentioned by Nassouhi is not known and, therefore, the object could not be located and examined. Thus, “EŞ 7864 + EŞ 6671” is tentatively included here as an uncertain exemplar (ex. 1*). The master text and the lineation of the edition follow ex. 1.

Layard discovered in 1846 numerous bronze weights in the shape of crouching lions. These sixteen lions, whose weights range from a half  mina  to fifteen  mina s, were found under a colossal human-headed winged bull in Ashurnasirpal II’s palace at Kalḫu (the North-West Palace); see p. 17 for some further details. One of the smaller lion weights belongs to Sennacherib. It bears an Akkadian inscription (lines 1–3) stating that the object belonged to this king and weighed one half  mina , as well as a one-word Aramaic text (line 4) noting that the object weighed one-half  mina  (0.241 kg).

The inscription of the seal impression is not preserved on the Aššur (VAT 12374 and VAT 9424) and Tell Taʿyinat (T-1801) copies of Esarhaddon’s Succession Treaty and, therefore, those tablets are not included in the catalogue; see Frahm, KAL 3 pp. 135–136 and 255 nos. 70–71; and Lauinger, JCS 64 (2012) pp. 87–123. The inscription was collated from published photographs. Since the text is a seal impression, each exemplar has exactly the same text and no score is provided on the CD-ROM. The script is a mixture of Assyrian and contemporary Babylonian sign forms, with Assyrian forms predominating.   A.R.

This inscription includes a short prologue, a lengthy and detailed account of the king’s first campaign (late 704–early 702) against Marduk-apla-iddina II (biblical Merodach-baladan) and his Chaldean and Elamite allies, and a building report describing the renovation of Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal at Tarbiṣu; the same military narration was included on an inscription written on several clay cylinders discovered at Nineveh and Aššur (text no. 1). Although neither of the cylinders inscribed with this text are dated, the inscription was probably written early in 702 (Sennacherib’s 3rd regnal year). The scribe indicated in a colophon the total number of lines in the text; each copy was inscribed with sixty-nine lines of text (plus the one-line colophon). The inscription is sometimes referred to as the “First Campaign Cylinder.”    Access  Sennacherib 213  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q004018/]    Sources  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467007,P467008] :    (1)   Frahm, ISIMU 6 pp. 161–163 pls. 1–3  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467007/]       (2)   Frahm, ISIMU 6 pp. 134–141 T variants  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467008/]    Commentary   Two complete cylinders were found in clay boxes in the northwestern and southwestern corners of the main room of the Egallammes temple at Tarbiṣu, 50 cm below the pavement; note that the two prisms referred to by J.E. Curtis and A.K. Grayson in Iraq 44 (1982; pp. 92–93) are the cylinders edited here. The originals are in the Iraq Museum and, therefore, were not collated; moreover, their museum numbers are not known. The present edition is based on A. Sulaiman’s published copies and notes (list of variants) and Frahm’s edition. Sulaiman’s Text “a” is ex. 1, the master text for the edition. Ex. 2, Sulaiman’s Text “b,” is known only from two mostly illegible photographs and from the variants listed in his edition. Since the full text of ex. 2 is not known, no score is provided on the CD-ROM. Sulaiman’s variants, however, are listed at the back of the book.   The so-called “First Campaign Cylinder” is one of the earliest extant texts composed under the auspices of this king. Two versions of the text are presently known. The first is written on cylinders discovered at Aššur and Nineveh (text no. 1), and the second is inscribed on these two cylinders found at Tarbiṣu. The prologues and accounts of military narration of both editions are identical (with minor variants), but the building reports deviate: those from Aššur and Nineveh record work undertaken at Nineveh, while those from Tarbiṣu describe the rebuilding of Egallammes, the temple of the god Nergal in that city. For this reason, the  Aššur and Nineveh copies of the “First Campaign Cylinder” are edited separately from the Tarbiṣu copies. The textual differences between the two versions are listed in the on-page notes. E. Frahm has suggested that the scribe Nabû-zuqup-kēnu was the author of this inscription. For the evidence, see Frahm, ISIMU 6 (2003) pp. 157–160. For other biographical information on Nabû-zuqup-kēnu, see Baker and Pearce, PNA 2/2 pp. 912–913.

During the Iraqi excavations of the site, A. Sulaiman records discovering numerous slabs inscribed with the same inscription concerning the rebuilding of the Nergal temple there, many of which were damaged by fire. The slabs lined the cella and several other rooms near the main courtyard. Presumably some of the inscribed slabs uncovered by Sulaiman in the late 1960s were the same slabs that had been seen and copied in the mid-nineteenth century. The inscription is written in six lines on ex. 1 and in eight lines on ex. 3. Because ex. 2 is known only from orthographic variants and since ex. 3 is an exact duplicate of ex. 1, with no variants recorded, no score is provided on the CD-ROM.

L.W. King found eight sculpted panels, six near the village Shakh and two near the village Hasanah. Six of the panels have inscriptions and carved figures of the king. The remaining two panels were smoothed in preparation for engraving, but nothing further was done. The inscriptions are largely duplicates, but occasionally the texts have some major variations. Since most of the inscriptions are badly weathered and difficult to decipher, they have been grouped together here as exemplars of a single text. If they were better preserved it might have been necessary to edit some of them as separate texts. The subject and  terminus post quem  of the text is the fifth campaign of Sennacherib and, therefore, the inscriptions date to ca. 697.

King numbered the eight panels I–VIII, with panels VI and VIII being uninscribed. For panels I–V, King published copies, as well as an edition and notes, but for panel VII he published only a transliteration. Only the inscriptions on two panels (II and IV, respectively exs. 1 and 4) are reasonably legible. The inscriptions on the other four panels (I, II, V, and VII, respectively exs. 2, 3, 5, and 6) are badly weathered. The master text and line arrangement follows ex. 1 because that exemplar is the best preserved Judi Dagh inscription and because this is the line numbering used in previous publications, especially the dictionaries (AHw and CAD). Ex. 4, as far as it is preserved, appears to duplicate ex. 1, but in the case of lines 24b–31, neither ex. 1 nor ex. 4 is sufficiently preserved to be certain that both exemplars are exact duplicates. Exs. 2–3 and 5–6 all deviate significantly from ex. 1. For details, see the score on the CD-ROM and the on-page notes. Minor variants are listed at the back of the book.

These are commonly called the Bavian reliefs, but, in fact, Ḫinnis (now Kharusa), not Bavian, is the village closest to the beginning of the canal, the construction of which is described in this inscription. The creation of this canal was part of a larger network of canals and aqueducts constructed by Sennacherib to provide water year round to Nineveh. Besides the inscriptions and reliefs, there are numerous stone ruins, which may be the remains of a building that Sennacherib used as a summer residence. The text is written three times on the rock face, with only minor variants. The inscription begins with an invocation of the god Aššur and other gods, the king’s name, titles, and epithets, and a brief survey of his achievements (lines 1–5a). This is followed by a detailed narrative, which is often difficult to understand, due in part to the damaged state of preservation of the text; this records the construction of several canals in the region in order to divert the local water to Nineveh (lines 5b–34a). Sennacherib boasts that the work was carried out with only a small number of workmen. The text then describes two campaigns against Babylonia. The first (lines 34b–43a) is the well-known “eighth” campaign, which included the battle of Ḫalulê (691). The second (lines 43b–54a) involved the capture and destruction of Babylon (689). The inscription concludes with a description of the creation of inscribed and sculpted reliefs at Bavian and a curse on any future ruler who might tamper with the canal (lines 54b–60). The  terminus post quem  for the inscription is the conquest of Babylon in late 689 and, therefore, it was probably written ca. 688. The text is commonly referred to as the “Bavian Inscription.”    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q004028/]  or the  score  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q004028/score]  of Sennacherib 223     Sources  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q004028/sources] :    (1)   Layard, MS C fol. 2r and fol. 3r  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467041/]  (Layard, MS C fol. 87r; Layard, MS D p. 16; King, Bavian copies “Central Panel”)    (2)   MS C fol. 1r–1v  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467042/]  (King, Bavian copies “Upper Panel”)    (3)   Layard, MS C fol. 82r–82v  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467043/]  (King, Bavian copies “Lower Panel”)    Commentary   These inscriptions have been an enigma since the decipherment of cuneiform. A.H. Layard was the first modern western explorer to face the challenge of making squeezes, studying, copying, and publishing the cuneiform inscriptions written on the high and precipitous cliff in the area of Bavian. This he did in 1852. Many descriptions of Layard’s explorations have been published, both by himself and by others, so it is unnecessary to repeat this information here; for details, see for example Larsen, Conquest of Assyria and the literature cited there.  However, his original copies of the Bavian inscriptions (exs. 1a–c, 2a, and 3a, as well as a later copy of ex. 1 [see below]), which are in the Department of the Middle East in the British Museum, have never been published properly. Only composite versions of these have been made public; see the copy in 3 R (pl. 14), which has served as the principle source for this inscription since 1870. Careful comparison of Layard’s original copies and the published versions, however, shows wide discrepancies; these are confirmed by unpublished copies of L.W. King (exs. 1d, 2b, and 3b).   The next explorer to seriously study the Bavian inscriptions was L.W. King. Unfortunately, King died prematurely, partly as a result of diseases he contracted during his travels, so he never fully published the results of his investigations. Fortunately, he left behind his unpublished notes and manuscripts, of which his completely new copies of the inscriptions take pride of place; these manuscripts are also in the Archives of the Department of the Middle East. Those copies (exs. 1d, 2b, and 3b), which he made at considerable bodily risk and discomfort during the spring of 1904, have never been fully published.  King referred to them in his Tukulti-Ninib I pp. 114–121, where he edited several lines (lines 43b–54a); in his partial edition, his A is ex. 2b, his B is ex. 1d, and his C is ex. 3b. King says in a letter published by Bachmann: “I took plenty of photos at Bavian” (Bachmann, Felsreliefs p. IV), but these photographs, which are now in the British Museum, include only general views of Bavian. In 1914, King corresponded with E. Meyer, who intended to lead a small team to Bavian in order to do a thorough study and take detailed photographs. King generously sent the results of his own work to Meyer with advice about what still needed to be done.   Subsequently, in the spring of 1933, T. Jacobsen and S. Lloyd (OIP 24 pp. 36–39) studied the remains at Bavian in connection with their work on the Jerwan aqueduct. Jacobsen provided new readings of some difficult passages in the text and important observations on the work that Sennacherib had done in the region to provide a better water supply for Nineveh.   A major question is how many times the text was copied in antiquity; in other words, how many exemplars were there. Sennacherib states the following: “At the ‘mouth’ of the canal that I caused to be dug in the region of the mountain, [ I ma ] de  six stele[s] (and) I  fashioned  image(s) of the great gods, my lords, upon them. Moreover, I had a royal image of myself expressing humility (lit. ‘one who strokes the nose’) placed before them” (lines 54b–56a). Based on this, one expects to find six inscribed and sculpted panels at Bavian. Layard, however, states that he found “eleven small tablets” and “across three of these royal tablets are inscriptions” (Discoveries pp. 210–211). King, in a letter published by Bachmann, presents a sketch showing the location of eleven “small panels sculptured with standing figures of Sennacherib, Nos. 4, 7, and 11 bear inscriptions in addition to the royal figure” (Bachmann, Felsreliefs p. V fig. 1). Later in the same letter he says: “At Mahad [on the way to Bavian], a neighbouring village, I found several inscribed stones built into the houses, two of which bore Sennacherib's name” (ibid. p. VI). Among Layard’s manuscripts there are three exemplars represented, several on-the-spot copies (exs. 1a–c, 2a, and 3a) and a later copy (see below). King has also left copies of three exemplars (exs. 1d, 2b, and 3b). Layard’s exemplars are identical with the three exemplars copied by King; these identifications are based on their having the same line division and variants. In general, Layard’s copies show less text preserved than King’s copies. This is odd because one would expect that with the passage of time between Layard and King the incised reliefs would have suffered further damage from the elements. King, however, could read cuneiform, whereas Layard could not and, therefore, the former was probably able to recognize more signs than the latter.   In the catalogue and in the score on the CD-ROM the various copies are treated separately. Each hand-drawn facsimile is regarded as a different version of the same exemplar because the copies all stem from the same inscribed object and, therefore, each copy is assigned the same exemplar number, but with a different lowercase letter appended to it in order to differentiate the various sources of information about what is on the exemplar. Layard’s later copy of ex. 1 (MS C fols. 81v–80r) is excluded from the catalogue and score on the grounds that it is not an accurate copy of that inscription; it includes material from the other two exemplars and has a number of copyist errors (generally omitted signs). In addition, the copies in 3 R (pl. 14) and G. Smith, Senn. (pp. 129–135 and 157–160) are not included in the catalogue as exemplars since those copies conflate the contents of all three exemplars. These copies, however, are sometimes referred to in the on-page notes.   The lineation follows ex. 2 because this is the line numbering used in previous publications, especially the dictionaries; this is also the lineation used in 3 R (pl. 14) and Luckenbill, Senn. (pp. 78–85). The master text is a conflation of all three exemplars, but with preference given to exs. 1 and 2, when possible. A score is presented on the CD-ROM and the variants are listed at the back of the book.

Their state of preservation is described by the excavators T. Jacobsen and S. Lloyd (OIP 24 p. 23) as follows: “Inscription  D  is unfortunately in an almost hopeless state of preservation. West of the wadis we found that the south façade of the aqueduct had been strengthened with a new shell of masonry (cf. pp. 9–10). A great many of the stones used for this purpose bore traces of  an inscription; but it soon became clear that the stones, before they were used to strengthen the aqueduct, had formed part of some other building, on the façade of which the inscription had originally been carved. In re-using these stones no account had been taken of the old inscription, and fragments of it were consequently scattered haphazardly among uninscribed blocks (p. 9 fig. 3 and p. 24 fig. 7; cf. pl. X A ). In some cases the inscription had been turned sideways, in others upside down; but it seemed that generally the masons had placed the inscribed face outward, no doubt because it had the advantage of being already worked. The inscription had suffered serious damage when margins were cut on many of the blocks, so that not infrequently both the top and the bottom line of text have disappeared altogether. ... There is reason to believe, however, that more inscribed blocks would be found if the masonry were taken down stone by stone.” The order and content of the majority of the 202 copied blocks is still unknown. Jacobsen and Lloyd (ibid. pp. 23–27) and E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 155–159 T 126) have made some progress on putting this jigsaw puzzle of an inscription back together and their reconstructions have been followed here. The inscription, when complete, was written in at least three columns, with a minimum height of at least nine courses of blocks per column and approximately sixteen to twenty-one signs per line (with each line stretching over seven blocks); each course usually contained three lines of text. Each column of text contained about twenty-six lines of text, making the inscription at least seventy-eight lines long. From the traces of paint still on the blocks, it appears that the space occupied by the text was accentuated by red paint. This text is sometimes referred to as “[Jerwan] Inscription D.”    Access  Sennacherib 228  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/Q004033/]    Source:    Jacobsen and Lloyd, OIP 24 pp. 23–27 and pls. X and XIX–XXX Inscription D  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/P467048/]    Commentary   The number of columns and lines of text cited above follows E. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 155–159); T. Jacobsen and S. Lloyd (OIP 24 pp. 23–25), uncertain if this inscription had more than two columns, state that Inscription D had at least fifty-two lines of text. It is certain from block nos. 88, 136, and 170, all of which have double vertical lines, that the inscription had no less than two columns. Based on the number of known blocks — not including any stones still to be discovered — it seems likely that there were at least three columns of text. However, as Frahm (Sanherib pp. 156–157) has already mentioned, it is uncertain if the known 202 blocks belong to one inscription or two different inscriptions/exemplars (see the discussion of the first campaign below).   At least one block (no. 91) can tentatively be assigned to the text’s prologue since it mentions the god Anu ( d a-num ); cf. text no. 223 line 1 and text no. 230 line 1. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that this piece belongs to another part of the text. The first campaign (against Marduk-apla-iddina II and his allies) is known from the following groups of blocks: Fragment A = nos. 143 + 144 + 152; Fragment B = nos. 56 + 79 (+) 62; Fragment C = nos. 103 + 123 + 110 + 61; Fragment D = nos. 74 + 73 + 111; and Fragment E = nos. 71 + 59. That campaign is also preserved on nos. 124 and 132. Jacobsen and Lloyd (OIP 24 pp. 25 and 27) suggest that Fragment A, Fragment C, and block no. 124 indirectly join; see Figure 27 on the next page. Frahm (Sanherib p. 158 T 126 §b) correctly notes that it is unlikely that Fragments A and C belong to the same course of blocks since block no. 124 records Marduk-apla-iddina II fleeing for his life and Sennacherib entering the palace in Babylon to plunder it, and Fragment C records the plundering of Marduk-apla-iddina II’s palace. Therefore, Fragment C cannot come immediately before block no. 124; in fact, it comes after it. Frahm (ibid.) tentatively advances the proposal that Fragment B could come from the last row of blocks of the first column of text, that is, the same course of blocks as Fragment A. This fits well with an indirect join to block no. 124, but this would make the width of column one of the inscription wider than column two. Since the relationship between Fragment A, Fragment B, and Fragment C, and block no. 124 is uncertain, these groups are edited separately. Because Fragment C could duplicate Fragment D and/or Fragment E and because there is some uncertainty as to the arrangement of Fragment A and Fragment B, especially with regard to their relationship to block no. 124, the 202 known Jerwan “Inscription D” blocks could belong to more than one inscription of Sennacherib or more than one exemplar of the same text. The text is not sufficiently preserved to be able to make any firm conclusions on the matter.   The second campaign (against the Kassites and Yasubigallians, and the land Ellipi) is known from the following groups of blocks: Fragment F = nos. 149 + 31 (+) 33; Fragment G = nos. 26 + 20 + 29 + 27 + 60; Fragment H = nos. 34 (+) 39 (+) 35 + 37 (+) 32 + 55; and Fragment I = nos. 45 + ?  41 + ?  47. That campaign is also preserved on nos. 3 and 70; see the on-page notes. For details on the joins and contents, see Frahm, Sanherib p. 158 T 126 §c. Frahm (Sanherib p. 158 T 126 §d) points out that numerous other blocks appear to be inscribed with an account of military narration, possibly reports of campaigns other than Sennacherib’s first or second campaign. These are block nos. 2, 16, 23, 30, 42–43, 49, 53, 65–66, 68, 75, 80, 84, 86–87, 94, 104, 108, 113–114, 116, 118–119, 130, 135–136, 140, 145–146, 150–151, 153, 157–158, 164 + 109, 167, 173, 176, 178–180, 184, and 195. Nos. 164 + 109 are edited as Fragment J. None of the other blocks, however, are sufficiently preserved to warrant an edition; for transliterations of these pieces, see Frahm, Sanherib p. 158. At least one block comes from the building report: nos. 69 + 121 + 67 + 117. That passage is edited here as Fragment K. Frahm (Sanherib pp. 157–158 T 126 §e) tentatively suggests that the following pieces also belong to the building report, the exact content of which is presently not known: nos. 88, 122, 167, 176–177, 182–183, 189, and 192–194. Those blocks are not edited here since too little on them is preserved; see Frahm, Sanherib p. 158 for transliterations.

Safar and F. Basmaji investigated the remains of a wall constructed of large stone blocks (62×43×80 cm each) and the entrance to a tunnel along the Bastura. The ancient structure had been known since at least 1932. The tunnel — approximately the first 15 m of which remained in situ at the time of discovery — was built entirely of stone ashlars and slabs. The height of the entrance is 1.2 m and the width of the tunnel is 1.12 m for the first 6 m and 2.7 m thereafter. For a map showing the location of the remains, as well as a plan and section of the stone structure, see Safar, Sumer 3 (1947) Map 2 and Plan 1, Arabic section. An inscription written on one of the ashlars inside the tunnel (the sixth block from the entrance in the third course) states that Sennacherib was the king who commissioned the project. The text is similar in style and language to text no. 226; in particular, compare lines 3–5 to text no. 226 lines 5–6. The text was not collated since the block bearing the inscription was stolen in the early 1990s (MacGinnis, Erbil p. 71).

The inscription also has some information not found in other known inscriptions of this king, in particular the setting up and inscribing of a victory stele in the plain of Ḫalulê after the battle there (691), the enlargement of the city Sūr-marrati (probably the site of Samarra), and the construction of that city’s wall. In the style of texts written on steles (and rock reliefs), the inscription begins with an invocation of gods (lines 1–2), the king’s name and epithets (lines 3–5a), and a statement about the god Aššur supporting Sennacherib, in particular during his campaigns to Chaldea and Elam (lines 5b–11a). The military narration is very unusual, not only in the manner in which the campaigns are recorded, but also in the number of campaigns recorded. To conform with the king’s annalistic narration on clay prisms, Sennacherib boasts of eight successful campaigns, with the centerpiece of the narrative being the eighth  (the battle of Ḫalulê), but he describes in detail only three of them — his sixth (694–693), seventh (late 693), and eighth (691) campaigns. Before narrating the battle of Ḫalulê, Sennacherib states that he campaigned against Chaldea four times (the first, fourth, sixth, and eighth campaigns) and against Elam three times (the sixth, seventh, and eighth campaigns), but no details are given about those individual campaigns. The inscription then narrates the events leading up to the battle of Ḫalulê (lines 11b–59a), the battle itself and its aftermath (lines 59b–112), and the placing of an inscribed victory stele on the field of battle (lines 113–114). Reports of the king’s sixth and seventh campaigns (lines 16b–19a and 19b–41a respectively) are included as part of the background to Sennacherib marching south against Mušēzib-Marduk, the king of Babylon; this was probably done to explain why Sennacherib regarded the Elamite king Umman-menanu (Ḫumban-menanu) as “a rash fellow who does not have sense or insight.” Those events are introduced by the formulae “on the first occasion” and “on the second occasion” respectively, and recorded in subordinate clauses, with all of the verbs marked by the subordinate marker - u . The building report (lines 115–120a) records that Sennacherib enlarged the city Sūr-marrati and built its wall; the king states that he decided to carry this work out after spending the night there. The text is dated to the eponymy of Nabû-kēnu-uṣur (690), which is wrongly called in the text the “fourteenth year of Sennacherib”; this eponymy is actually the king’s 15th regnal year. This text is sometimes referred to as the “Baltimore Inscription,” the “Walters Inscription,” the “Washington Inscription,” and the “Sūr-marrati Inscription”; exs. 1 and 2 are named after the cities in which they now reside (Baltimore and Washington DC respectively).

Banks by the Walters Art Gallery (Baltimore) on March 16, 1931. At the time of sale, Banks stated that the stone tablet was from Sennacherib’s palace at Nineveh. Given the information provided in the text itself (lines 115–121), the reliability of Banks’ statement is questionable. The inscription gives the city Sūr-marrati as its place of origin and, therefore, Samarra is probably the provenance of the tablet; for the identification of ancient Sūr-marrati as modern Samarra, see Sachs, JAOS 57 (1937) pp. 419–420; and Postgate, RLA 13/3–4 (2012) p. 329. The preserved part of the tablet consists of one large fragment and two small ones; about one quarter of the tablet is missing (the bottom right hand side). Where the fragments have been joined together, the plaster has obliterated a few signs. The upper part of the obverse and lower part of the reverse are well preserved, but the lower part of the obverse and the upper part of the reverse are badly broken, damaged, and to a certain extent incrusted with salt, making the text on those parts of the tablet difficult to decipher.   Ex. 2 is a small fragment of a stone tablet that preserves a small section of the beginning and end of the inscription; parts of the first nineteen lines of the obverse and parts of the last seven lines of the reverse are extant. The object, when examined by V. Scheil (RB 9 [1900] pp. 424–427), was owned by the Catholic University of America (Washington DC). The authors have not been able to locate the object and, therefore, it is not known if that piece is still in the possession of the Catholic University of America or if it is now owned by another institution or individual. Scheil stated at the time of publication that the tablet originated from Nineveh, but there is no other evidence to support that claim. R. Borger (BAL 2  p. 67) correctly identified the piece in the Catholic University of America in Washington as a duplicate of the Walters Art Galley tablet.   A.K. Grayson (AfO 20 [1963] p. 83) and E. Weissert (HSAO 6 p. 199 and nn. 57–58) both think that the inscription is a copy of one on a victory stele set up at Ḫalulê after the battle, but with a building report added. If this interpretation is correct, then the account of Sennacherib’s eighth campaign in this text is likely a copy of one of the first reports of those events. Therefore, this report of the battle of Ḫalulê is earlier in date than the best known version of his eighth campaign, which is preserved in text no. 18 v 1'–vi 15', text no. 22 v 17–vi 35, and text no. 23 v 9–vi 30; that description of the events was probably modeled on the military narration on the now-lost Ḫalulê stele. Moreover, Grayson (AfO 20 [1963] p. 87) proposes that a letter to a god could have been a likely source for some of the contents of this text; this proposal, however, cannot be presently supported by the extant Sennacherib corpus. For further information about the unusual style of the inscription, see ibid. pp. 83–89.   The master text is ex. 1; the lineation of ex. 2 is marginally different. Lines 1–63 are on the obverse of ex. 1 and lines 64–126 are on the reverse. Since ex. 2 duplicates lines 1–20 and 120–126, a partial score is provided on the CD-ROM; the few minor variants are listed at the back of the book. Since ex. 2 was not available for study, the transliteration in the score generally follows Scheil’s edition. Lines 11b–108a — the report of the eighth campaign (the battle of Ḫalulê), with the imbedded accounts of the sixth and seventh campaigns — duplicate with major variation text no. 22 iv 37b–39a, 44b–45, 55–v 11a, and 31–vi 35; text no. 34 lines 20–25a and 36b–55a; and text no. 35 lines 16'–52'.

Since Esarhaddon appears to be referred to as “senior-ranking son,” the object was probably commissioned after his official nomination as heir designate.

The inlays from the eyes and forehead are missing. The inscription runs along the edge of the left side of the lion’s face, under the jaw, and then on the edge of the other side of the face. Someone attempted to carefully erase Sennacherib’s name without damaging the piece or drawing attention to the erasure; see Frahm, Sanherib pl. VII. The provenance of the piece is not entirely certain. As indicated by its registration number (AH 82-7-14,4464), BM 91678 is registered as coming from Abu Habba, ancient Sippar. However, J. Reade (in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 104 no. 650) suggests that Nineveh is a more probable provenance since Abu Habba provenances have been assigned to objects that seem more likely to have originated from northern Iraq. He speculates that this was because those objects may have been placed on display shortly after arriving in the British Museum from the Museum’s concurrent excavations at Babylon, Nineveh, Sippar, and other sites and, as a result, their original find spots were forgotten before they were registered (ibid. p. 11 no. 10).

Based on the phrases used and the content, this text should be assigned to either Sargon II or Sennacherib. While there has been much discussion of this point, mainly among biblical scholars, the text cannot be attributed with certainty until more evidence is available. The text is arbitrarily edited here with inscriptions possibly belonging to Sennacherib. More information is also needed to decide whether this is a normal annalistic text or a letter to a god.

Shai (UF 38 [2006] pp. 745–754), however, think that the inscription belongs to Sennacherib. In addition, a number of dates for the events described in the text have been suggested: (1) 720, Sargon II’s campaign against rebels in the west (Fuchs followed by Frahm); (2) 712, Sargon II’s campaign to Philistia (Galil and Tadmor); (3) 701, Sennacherib’s third campaign (Maeir, Naʾaman, Zukerman and Shai); and (4) after 689 (Shea, proposing that Sennacherib campaigned against Judah a second time). For further details on the attribution of the text, see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 230–232. Only a sample of the relatively extensive literature on the historical aspects of this text has been cited in the bibliography. Regardless of whether the text belongs to Sargon II or Sennacherib, the tablet was probably inscribed in the reign of Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal, as suggested by the writing of Aššur’s name as AN.ŠÁR. Therefore, K 6205 + 82-3-23,131 could be an archival copy. Note, however, that Aššur’s name is sometimes written as AN.ŠÁR in Sargon’s reign; see Hawkins, Studies Grayson p. 160 Side B line 13.

The attribution to Sennacherib, rather than some other Neo-Assyrian king (Sargon II, Esarhaddon, or Ashurbanipal) is very tentative, as already pointed out by E. Frahm. Should this inscription be part of the Sennacherib corpus, then the extant text on the obverse may describe work at Bavian; see text no. 223 for further information. Moreover, it is not entirely certain which face is the obverse and which is the reverse; the edition presented here follows Frahm’s understanding of the tablet.

The inscription was deliberately mutilated in antiquity and, therefore, is difficult to read. Despite this, the text appears to record the name of a woman attached to Sennacherib. One of the king’s wives — Tašmētu-šarrat, Naqīʾa (Zakūtu), or another woman whose name is not otherwise attested (see the on-page note to line 2) — is generally thought to have been the owner of this stele; the difficult-to-read traces in line 2 do not seem to fit the names of Tašmētu-šarrat, Naqīʾa, or Zakūtu. Recently, E. Frahm and E. Weissert have proposed that the object belonged to the mother of Sennacherib and they suggest that we should read the name as Raʾīmâ (meaning “beloved”), a suggestion that is tentatively followed here. For further information on the identity of the woman whose name is written on this stele and the circumstances surrounding its defacement, see Frahm, Sanherib pp. 184–185 I.2; Frahm, Sennacherib at the Gates of Jerusalem pp. 179–180; Liverani in Lippolis, Sennacherib Wall Reliefs p. 16 and n. 109; Radner, Studies Fales p. 694; and Reade, Studies Larsen p. 463.

Note, however, that ex. 1 divides the text into two lines, whereas the inscription is written in a single line on ex. 2. The line count of the edition follows ex. 2. Because both inscriptions are fully preserved and there are no variants, no score is provided on the CD-ROM. An image of a scorpion is incised on both amphoras, on the shoulder near the inscription. It has long been thought that the scorpion represented the Assyrian queen, much like the image of the lion represents the Assyrian king. For a recent study of the image of the scorpion, with references to previous literature, see Niederreiter, Iraq 70 (2008) pp. 59–62; and Radner, Studies Fales pp. 690–693.
