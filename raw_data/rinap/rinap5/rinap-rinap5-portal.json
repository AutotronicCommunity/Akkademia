      "text": "After the death of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon in late 669 BC, Assyria, its temples, and its people continued to thrive under Ashurbanipal. During the early part of his reign, the Assyrian Empire reached its greatest extent, possibly covering more territory than any empire the world had known up until that time. However, Assyria’s good fortune would not last; its glory faded even while Ashurbanipal sat upon the throne. Within about twenty years after his death in ca. 631 BC, Assyria ceased to exist as a political entity. By 612 BC, its penultimate king Sîn-šarra-iškun was dead and its largest and most important cities, including Aššur and Nineveh, lay abandoned and desolate, destroyed, and plundered by the Babylonians and Medes. The final death blow, however, did not come until three years, later since a certain Aššur-uballiṭ II had declare himself “king of Assyria” in the western part of the empire, in a cult center of the moon-god. In 609 BC, Aššur-uballiṭ and the Assyrian monarchy vanished from the face of the earth.    While 210 different inscriptions, attested by approximately 1,100 separate exemplars, are known for Ashurbanipal, Assyria’s last great ruler, only a few are preserved for Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarra-iškun, and none for Sîn-šumu-līšir and Aššur-uballiṭ II. Nearly all of the texts are written in the Standard-Babylonian dialect of the Akkadian language, but a few short texts are written in the Sumerian language. Ashurbanipal’s texts (which are often referred to as annals) describe his numerous victories on the battlefield  -- from Egypt to Iran and from Turkey to the marshes at the head of the Persian Gulf, and against such major states as Egypt, Elam and Babylonia, as well as against Arab tribes and Phoenician cities -- various building enterprises (such as royal palaces, temples, and city walls), and religious dedications (for example, the creation of a gold bow to the goddess Ištar), as well as his scholarly achievements (ability to read, write, do complex mathematics, and understand the practice of divination). The inscriptions range in length from simple one-line possession labels on stone vessels to detailed 1,300-line annalistic texts on clay prisms; some texts may exist in only one copy, while others may be known from approximately 250 exemplars. This website will eventually present all of the royal inscriptions of the five kings of Assyria who ruled northern Iraq from 668 BC to ca. 609 BC, together with a few resources and materials for their study and their historical context. However, as of May 2018, only 114 inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (including some written by one of his servants, the governor of Ur), 6 texts of Aššur-etel-ilāni (mostly from Babylonia), and 20 inscriptions of Sîn-šarra-iškun have been edited and lemmatized.     The aim of RINAP 5, a sub-project of  Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/index.html]   and the  Official Inscriptions of the Middle East in Antiquity (OIMEA) Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/oimea/index.html]  (which is part of the  Munich Open-access Cuneiform Corpus Initiative (MOCCI)  [https://www.en.ag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/research/mocci/index.html] , is to publish in a single place easily accessible and annotated (lemmatized) editions of all of the known Akkadian and Sumerian royal inscriptions of the last five kings of Assyria (668 BC-ca. 610 BC): Ashurbanipal, Aššur-etel-ilāni, Sîn-šumu-līšir, Sîn-šarra-iškun, and Aššur-uballiṭ II. For details, see the \" About the Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/abouttheproject/index.html] \" page. The corpus of edited texts in this RINAP/OIMEA sub-project presently includes:             In May 2018, the final, camera-ready manuscript of RINAP 5/1 was sent to the publisher (Eisenbrauns). The book is expected to appear in the second half of 2018. Because work on  The Royal Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (668–631 BC), Aššur-etel-ilāni (630–627 BC) and Sîn-šarra-iškun (626–612 BC), Kings of Assyria, Part 1  is completed, the text numbers assigned to the inscriptions edited in that volume (Ashurbanipal texts 1-71) will not change.  However, because work on  Part 2  (Ashurbanipal texts 72-2018, Aššur-etel-ilāni texts 1-6, and Sîn-šarra-iškun 1-21) is still very much a work in progress, we kindly ask you to be patient with us and to bear in mind that the information included under the RINAP 5/2 tab is far from complete and is subject to change. This is especially true of the text designations. This will be the case until the camera-ready manuscript of RINAP 5/2 is sent to the publisher. Therefore, we urge caution should you cite the content of  The Royal Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (668–631 BC), Aššur-etel-ilāni (630–627 BC) and Sîn-šarra-iškun (626–612 BC), Kings of Assyria, Part 2 .          The RINAP 5 sub-project has been made possible in part by major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor and with funding provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the establishment of the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Ancient History of the Near and Middle East."

They are listed here to help you search RINAP effectively.    Note:  Catalogue searches are not case sensitive.        Designation ( designation: )   This is the RINAP-assigned designation of the composite text. At present, one can search the corpus using the following criteria:         ashurbanipal [with or without a text number designation (from 001 to 058 and 2001 to 2016)]    ashurbanipal_babylonian [with or without a text number designation (from 01 to 23)]       ashurbanipal_tablet [with or without a text number designation (from 01 to 04)]   aššur-etel-ilani [with or without a text number designation (1)]   aššur-etel-ilani_babylonian [with or without a text number designation (from 1 to 5)]   sin-šarra-iškun [with or without a text number designation (from 01 to 20)]      Sample search : designation:ashurbanipal_tablet_02.         Genre ( genre: )    The only genre search option for this project is “royal_inscription”; note that the search displays all of the texts in the corpus.       Popular Name ( popular: )   Few terms are included in the “Popular” modern designation of the compositions. In some instances on this sub-project, the \"popular name\" is the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (Babylonian Periods) designation (format: RIMB 2 B.6.32.N or RIMB 2 B.6.35.N). For the search to work, you must enter the full RIMB 2 designation. For example, to display Ashurbanipal Babylonian 1 you can search for \"popular:B.6.32.1\". For example, the follow search options will yield results:        Epigraph     Large_Egyptian_Tablets     Mullissu Inscription     Nabû_Inscription    Prism_A            Collection ( collection: )   Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions are housed in numerous museum collections around the world.

      "text": "The present series of publications, Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP), is intended to present up-to-date editions of the royal inscriptions of a number of Neo-Assyrian rulers. It is modeled on the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) series and carries on where the RIMA (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Assyrian Periods) publications ended. The RIM Project was initiated by A. Kirk Grayson at the University of Toronto in 1979 and over the years received extensive support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, and private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff. In all, it produced ten volumes in its various sub-series. Grayson retired from the University of Toronto in 2000 and a few years later found it necessary to cease scholarly pursuits due to personal and family illnesses. At that time, he handed over responsibility for the work of the project to me, formerly the assistant director and at times acting director of the RIM Project. When I took up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and the last RIM volume (RIME 1 by Douglas R. Frayne) appeared in early 2008, the RIM Project officially ceased to exist. Work on several further volumes of inscriptions of Assyrian and Babylonian rulers had already begun during the time of the RIM Project and Grayson passed on responsibility for the materials and manuscripts to me. In 2007, I initiated the current project in order to continue the task of making the official inscriptions of the several important Neo-Assyrian rulers available in modern, scholarly editions. While the volumes in the new series resemble the format of the RIM volumes in most matters, the RINAP volumes include indices of proper names, and editions of the texts are also available online, in connection with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) and the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus Initiative (Oracc).    Four volumes have already appeared in this series: RINAP 1, comprising the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V (begun by Hayim Tadmor and completed by Shigeo Yamada); RINAP 3/1–2, comprising the inscriptions of Sennacherib (begun by A. Kirk Grayson and completed by his collaborator Jamie Novotny); and RINAP 4, comprising the inscriptions of Esarhaddon (by Erle Leichty, with a contribution by Grant Frame). The complete corpus of the royal inscriptions of Ashurbanipal and his successors Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarra-iškun is presented in two parts, with the present volume being the first part (RINAP 5/1, by Jamie Novotny and Joshua Jeffers). With the collaboration of Andreas Fuchs for two texts, I am preparing RINAP 2, the inscriptions of Sargon II.    The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the RINAP Project research grants in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 to help carry out its work and my thanks must be expressed to it. My appreciation must also be extended to the University of Pennsylvania and to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, where the project is based, for their support. Additional funding for the preparation of RINAP 5/1 was provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (through the establishment of the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Ancient History of the Near and Middle East) and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Historisches Seminar – Abteilung Alte Geschichte). I am grateful to Karen Radner for providing additional financial support for the project.      Philadelphia, May 2018   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "As has been said about all of the volumes in this series, the preparation of the book has taken far longer than expected, partly because of the high number of inscriptions of Ashurbanipal; for Part 1 alone, over 700 objects (including a few with approximately 1,300 lines of text each) had to be collated. The delay was compounded by the unexpected closure of the Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project resulting in a long period when no research was done at all. Grant Frame, with the encouragement of Erle Leichty, rescued the Ashurbanipal project in 2007 when he founded the Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project at the University of Pennsylvania with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The authors are extremely grateful to Professors Frame and Leichty for their initiative. There were further delays between 2008 and 2014, when Jamie Novotny assisted Grayson, Leichty, and Yamada in completing RINAP 3/1–2, RINAP 4, and RINAP 1. Thus, renewed work on RINAP 5 only began again in late 2014, with a minor pause in August–September 2015 when Novotny moved to Munich and Jeffers joined the project.    New editions of the complete corpus of inscriptions of Ashurbanipal and his successors had been planned from the inception of the RIM Project in 1981. In 1988, Laurence Shiff was assigned the task of preparing RIMA 8, Ashurbanipal and His Successors (668–612 BC). The publication was envisioned as a four-volume work: Part 1 was to include the early annals (665–648), Part 2 the later annals (647–643), Part 3 the summary inscriptions, and Part 4 the miscellaneous texts. The books were to be published between 1993 and 2000. In 1989, Shiff collated all of the pieces in the British Museum (London) that were to appear in Part 1. By the end of June 1990, significant progress had been made on Parts 1 and 3, little progress on Part 2 had been undertaken, and only a cursory review of the Part 4 texts had been made. In the early 1990s, Shiff left Assyriology to run the family business and Pamela Gerardi, a recent Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, replaced him. Shiff’s notes and computer files were handed over to her to continue the task of editing the inscriptions. In January 1995, Gerardi made a short collation trip to the British Museum.    Work on RIMA 8 was completely rebooted in late 1996, shortly after Borger’s BIWA appeared. That scholar’s significant contributions to the corpus were intended to serve as the foundation for the books. Around that time, Grayson asked Grant Frame, Douglas Frayne, Erle Leichty, Simo Parpola, and Ron Sweet to assist Gerardi. Sweet (then the editor-in-chief of RIM) took over the day-to-day management of the volume. Frame and Frayne, as well as Grayson himself, were to work on the texts once they had finished their then-current tasks, the completion of the Sargon II corpus, the Presargonic inscriptions, and the Sennacherib texts respectively. Parpola (the Director of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project) was to prepare the translations. In 1997, Karljürgen Feuerherm was hired as a part-time student assistant to begin entering Borger’s handwritten transliterations of the numerous Prism F and A exemplars into a digital format. In 1998, Sweet spent six weeks in the British Museum collating the principal exemplars of Prism F, as well as a few other inscriptions. In 1999, Jamie Novotny took over the task of entering transliterations of Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions; he started with Prisms B, D, C, Kh, and T, before moving on to the numerous tablets published by T. Bauer in his two-volume Asb. Between 1999 and 2003, approximately 95% of the complete corpus of Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions had been entered into Microsoft Word files.    In late 2000, Novotny started a dissertation on Ashurbanipal’s building projects at Ḫarrān and, as part of that study, he examined, collated, and edited numerous inscriptions of that Assyrian king. Several collation trips to the British Museum (London) and the Oriental Institute (Chicago) were made in 2001 and 2002. After finishing his dissertation in 2003, Novotny continued working on RIMA 8 part-time; much of his time was spent helping Leichty with the then RIMA 7 (Esarhaddon) volume. In 2004, Novotny left the field of Assyriology, but continued working on Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions in his spare time. Living in Chicago afforded him the opportunity to collate texts in the Oriental Institute. In 2007, when he returned to Assyriology by taking a term post at Brown University, Novotny set his sights on finishing RIMA 8. From August 2007 to June 2009, significant progress was made; first drafts of the translations of all of the prisms were prepared. In collaboration with Greta Van Buylaere, editions of numerous texts written on tablets were completed; Van Buylaere kindly collated many pieces in the British Museum. The preparation of the material, however, was put on hold when Novotny started work at the RINAP Project in 2009; priority was given to completing the volumes of inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III, Shalmaneser V, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon. Work on RINAP 5 (formerly RIMA 8) resumed in mid-2014. The project was initially funded by the University of Pennsylvania in 2014–15 and then by the National Endowment for the Humanities (2015 onwards). Beginning in August 2015, Novotny’s work on Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions has also been supported by LMU Munich and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through the establishment of the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Ancient History of the Near and Middle East (Karen Radner). In August 2015, Joshua Jeffers took over Novotny’s duties as the Research Specialist for the RINAP Project. The present volume is the result of the collaboration of Novotny and Jeffers.    As for the division of labor, Novotny collated the exemplars of text nos. 1–8, 10, and 12–58 in the British Museum, as well as all of the Ashurbanipal material in the Oriental Institute (Chicago) and Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin); prepared the master texts of text nos. 1–57 and 61–71 and the scores of text nos. 1–8, 10, 13, 15, 20, 23, and 68–69; translated all of the inscriptions into English; wrote the book’s introduction, all of the text introductions, most of the commentaries, and the bulk of the on-page notes to text nos. 1–8, 10, and 12–58; prepared the catalogues, the preliminary bibliographies, and some of the front and back material. Jeffers collated most of the exemplars of text no. 9 and all of the copies of text nos. 11, 59–60, and 65–70 in the British Museum; prepared the scores of text nos. 9, 11, and 59–60 and updated the master texts of those five inscriptions; wrote almost all of the on-page notes of text nos. 9 and 11 and several of the notes for the other inscriptions; added most of the bibliography entries for publications appearing after 1994; and prepared some of the back material, especially the minor variants.    Work on the present corpus of texts necessitated extensive travel for collation of previously published inscriptions and for examination of unpublished material. The authors wish to thank the various museums and museum authorities that have cooperated in the preparation of this book. First, they would like to thank the directors, keepers, curators, and assistants of the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Berlin), the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Chicago), the British Museum (London), and the Louvre Museum (Paris). Specifically, the authors express their gratitude to John Brinkman, John Curtis, Walter Farber, Irving Finkel, Joachim Marzahn, Jonathan Taylor, and Christopher Walker. These colleagues, and their staff, have been extremely helpful and have extended to us every courtesy and assistance. Secondly, they would like to thank the Oriental Institute (specifically Susanne Paulus) and the Trustees of the British Museum for allowing the RINAP Project to publish photographs of objects bearing Ashurbanipal inscriptions.    As usual with a volume in this series, numerous individuals aided in the production of the volume in some way. Since the preparation of this book has spanned more than two decades, it is impossible to name everyone who has contributed to RINAP 5/1 and thus any omissions are unintentional.  While the authors have collated most of the texts themselves, other scholars have kindly collated some texts, provided information on pieces, or aided in some way. These include Israel Ephʿal, Jeanette Fincke, Grant Frame, Pamela Gerardi, Kirk Grayson, Enrique Jiménez, Mikko Luukko, Karen Radner, Micheal Roaf, Laurence Shiff, Ronald Sweet, Jonathan Taylor, Greta Van Buylaere, and Christopher Walker.    In Toronto, during the RIM years, and later in Philadelphia and Munich, several individuals contributed to the technical preparation of the volume and they deserve credit for performing tedious and time-consuming tasks. For the Toronto stage of production (1997–2004), the authors offer their gratitude to Karljürgen Feuerherm for entering the provisional transliterations of exemplars of Prisms F and A from Borger’s microfiche into a digital format; to Ronald Sweet for collating a few of the principal Prism F exemplars in the British Museum; and to Hope Grau and Jill Ruby for performing various other tasks. For the Munich and Philadelphia stages of production (2014–2017), the authors would like to thank the student assistants who helped in the completion of the volume: Yehonatan Heshkoviz, Daniel Patterson, and Irene Sibbing Plantholt. Last, but by no means least, special thanks must be given to Steve Tinney for undertaking the arduous task of generating the final camera-ready copy and converting and preparing the texts for the online version.    Members of the RINAP editorial board (especially Grant Frame and Karen Radner) and the project consultants offered helpful suggestions at various times near the completion of the volume. Their time, care, and generosity are greatly appreciated.    Erle Leichty † , to whom this book is dedicated, sadly passed away prior to the completion of this manuscript. Leichty served as a member of the RINAP Editorial Board from 2011 (after the publication of his RINAP 4 volume) until his death in 2016. His critical feedback, which stemmed from his vast knowledge of Mesopotamian history and secondary literature, always improved the quality of the books reviewed by him. The authors would like to acknowledge here their gratitude to Erle not only for his time, service, and generosity discussing all matters Neo-Assyrian, but also for his contributions to Assyriology.    The authors’ appreciation goes out to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Historisches Seminar - Alte Geschichte), the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the University of Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Research Collections Grant), and several private individuals, in particular Laurence Shiff and Malcolm Horsnell, whose financial support allowed for their travel to the numerous museums cited above and provided the funding necessary for them to conduct research in Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions and to publish this volume.    Last, but by no means least, the authors wish to record their gratitude for the ongoing support and encouragement of their families: Denise Bolton, Robert and Diana Novotny, and Jennifer Novotny; Jordan Wesolowski, Dave and Kathy Jeffers, and Heather Zeigler.

      "text": "The volumes in the RINAP series are modeled upon the publications of the now-defunct Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia (RIM) Project, with a few modifications, in particular the addition of indices of proper names. Like the RIM volumes, the volumes in this series are not intended to provide analytical or synthetic studies, but rather to provide basic text editions that can serve as the foundations for such studies. Thus, extensive discussions of the contents of the texts are not presented, and the core of each volume is the edition of the relevant texts.    In this volume, the order of the texts is based for the most part upon the following two criteria:    (1) The city at which the structure dealt with in the building or dedicatory portion of the text was located. If that information is not preserved on the text, the provenance of the inscribed object is the determining factor.     (2) The type of object upon which the inscription is written (prism, cylinder, tablet, etc.).      Following the practice of the RIM series, inscriptions that cannot be assigned definitely to a particular ruler are given text numbers beginning at 1001. Certain other inscriptions that provide information relevant for establishing royal names and titles (e.g. “servant seals”) and any composed in the name of another member of the royal family (e.g., royal wives) have been given numbers that begin at 2001.    In the volumes of the RINAP series, the term “exemplar” is employed to designate a single inscription found on one object. The term “text” is employed to refer to an inscription that existed in antiquity and that may be represented by a number of more or less duplicate exemplars. In these editions exemplars of one text are edited together as a “master text,” with a single transliteration and translation. Variants to the “master text” are provided either on page (major variants) or at the back of the volume (minor variants).     Each text edition is normally supplied with a brief introduction containing general information. This is followed by a catalogue containing basic information about all exemplars. This includes museum and excavation numbers (the symbol + is added between fragments that belong to the same object), provenance, lines preserved, and indication of whether or not the inscription has been collated (c = collated with the original, (c) = partially collated with the original, p = collated by means of a photograph, (p) = partially collated from a photograph; and n = not collated). The next section is normally a commentary containing further technical information and notes. The bibliography then follows. Items are arranged chronologically, earliest to latest, with notes in parentheses after each bibliographic entry. These notes indicate the exemplars with which the item is concerned and the nature of the publication, using the following key words: photo, copy, edition, translation, study, and provenance. Certain standard reference works (e.g., the various volumes of “Keilschriftbibliographie” and “Register Assyriologie” published in Orientalia and Archiv für Orientforschung respectively; Borger, HKL 1–3; AHw; CAD; and Seux, ERAS) are not normally cited, although they were essential in the collecting and editing of these texts. While the bibliographies should contain all major relevant items, they are not necessarily totally exhaustive; a vast amount of scattered literature exists on many of the inscriptions edited in this volume and much of this literature is of only limited scholarly interest.    As noted earlier, a distinction is made between major and minor variants to a “master text”; the major variants are placed at the bottom of the page and the minor variants at the back of the book. In brief, major variants are essentially non-orthographic in nature, while minor variants are orthographic variations. Orthographic variants of proper names may at times be significant and thus on occasion these will also appear on the page as major variants. Complete transliterations of all exemplars in the style of musical scores are found in the pdf on Oracc at http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/ and thus any reader who finds the notes on variants insufficient for his/her needs may check the full reading of any exemplar (the pdfs of the scores for previous RINAP volumes are also now available on Oracc). Such scores, however, are not normally given for bricks and seal inscriptions. Objects whose attribution to a particular text is not entirely certain are given exemplar numbers that are followed by an asterisk (*); for example, K 1716+ is regarded as text no. 3 (Prism B) ex. 2*, since it is uncertain that it is an exemplar of that text or text no. 4 (Prism D). Moreover, these exemplars are listed in separate catalogues (Catalogue of Uncertain Exemplars), beneath the main catalogue.     Several photographs are included in this volume. The selection includes some of the best preserved inscriptions on clay prisms, as well as several fragments of clay prisms and a fragment of a clay vertical cylinder. There are several photographs of the king’s inscriptions written on the wall slabs of the palaces at Nineveh, and there are images of a lapis-lazuli tablet, a stone tablet, and a glazed brick. These are intended to show a few of the object types upon which Ashurbanipal’s inscriptions were written and to aid the reader in understanding the current state of preservation of some of the inscriptions.    As is the normal practice for transliterating cuneiform inscriptions, lower case Roman is used for Sumerian and lower case italics for Akkadian; logograms in Akkadian texts appear in capitals. The system of sign values in Borger, Mesopotamisches Zeichenlexikon, is generally followed. Italics in the English translation indicate either an uncertain translation or a word in the original language. In general, the rendering of personal names follows the PNA; however, the names of Babylonian rulers follow the spelling used in RIMB 2 and those of Egyptian rulers are based on Borger, BIWA (who follows Onasch, ÄAT 27).    There are several differences between the RIM and RINAP styles. Among these, the most notable is that all partially preserved or damaged signs, regardless of how they are broken, now appear between half brackets (⸢ and ⸣). Thus, no partially preserved sign has square brackets ([ and ]) inserted in its transliteration; for example, [DINGI]R and LUGA[L KU]R appear in the transliteration as ⸢DINGIR⸣ and ⸢LUGAL KUR⸣ respectively. This change was made to ensure compatibility of the online RINAP editions with the standards of the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), the parent site and project where RINAP Online is housed. This change was implemented in the print version in order to present identical editions in RINAP 5 and RINAP Online. Note, however, that the translations may appear more damaged than their corresponding transliterations indicate, as the translations were prepared according to standard Assyriological practices; for example, ⸢DINGIR⸣ (= [DINGI]R) and ⸢LUGAL KUR⸣ (= LUGA[L KU]R) are translated as “[the go]d” and “king [of the lan]d,” and not “the god” and “king of the land.”    For RINAP 5, there is a small departure from previous volumes in the information provided in the catalogues: the dimensions are excluded. This decision was made primarily because a large number of objects were collated from high resolution images. Because these pieces were not examined directly from the original, the authors were not in a position to record the heights, widths, and thicknesses of many of the prism and tablet fragments edited here.     In addition to the indices of museum and excavation numbers and selected publications found in RIM volumes, the RINAP volumes also contain indices of proper names (personal names, topographical names, and divine names). Searchable online versions of the manuscripts are maintained on Oracc by MOCCI (Munich Open-access Cuneiform Corpus Initiative). Web versions of the editions are also hosted on CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative).     Philadelphia, May 2018   G. Frame, Editor-in-Chief"

      "text": "In 669, on the tenth of Araḫsamna (VIII), Esarhaddon died en route to invade Egypt. [1]  Unlike in 681, Assyria and Babylonia were prepared for a smooth transition of power. [2]  The queen mother, Naqīʾa (Zakūtu), ensured that her son’s succession plans were carried out exactly as he had planned in Ayyāru (II) 672: Ashurbanipal, Esarhaddon’s fourth eldest son, was to sit on the throne of Assyria, while Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, his eldest living son, was to become king of Babylon. [3]   Having already had several years of on-the-job training, not only in the House of Succession but also in the royal court itself, Ashurbanipal was sufficiently trained when he ascended the Assyrian throne in Kislīmu (IX) 669. [4]  During his long reign, [5]  the man who would be Assyria’s last great king regularly sent his armies on military expeditions, commanding them to travel farther afield than his predecessors (including his father and grandfather), and undertook large-scale building projects in numerous Assyrian and Babylonian cities, Nineveh and Babylon in particular. His fame and notoriety were remembered long after Assyria ceased to exist as a political entity (ca. 610). Ashurbanipal’s name and deeds were brought to light shortly after nineteenth-century European explorers began uncovering the ruins of Nineveh. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the texts and life of this late Neo-Assyrian king who is mentioned in the Bible (Asnappar) and classical sources (Sardanapalus) have been the subject of many scholarly publications.    Sources for Ashurbanipal’s long reign are not only abundant, but informative; however, there are very few extant sources for the final decade of his reign (ca. 642–631). His royal inscriptions provide many details about his victories on the battlefield, the (unusual) fates of his contemporaries, and the construction and renovation of city walls, palaces, and temples. These self-aggrandizing compositions, which present biased accounts that do not always accurately record “historical reality,” are supplemented by laconic chronographic texts (the so-called Babylonian Chronicle), (scholarly, priestly, and administrative) letters, astrological reports, queries to the sun-god, legal and administrative documents, and grants, as well as by numerous bas reliefs sculpted on orthostats that lined the walls of his and his grandfather’s palaces at Nineveh. The Bible, some classical sources, and an Aramaic tale written in Demotic script also provide insight into his reign.          Notes       1  Grayson, Chronicles p. 86 no. 1 iv 30–31 and p. 127 no. 14 lines 28´–30´.        2  See below for details about the succession.        3  For information on Ashurbanipal’s name, his family background, and his responsibilities during his father’s reign (including the relevant source material), see in particular Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 139–140 and 159; Novotny and Singletary, Studies Parpola pp. 167–177; Weissert, PNA 1/1 pp. 159–163 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I (with references to earlier bibliography). It is now generally believed that Aššur-bāni-apli was not Ashurbanipal’s birth name, but rather his throne name, and that he was Esarhaddon’s fourth eldest son. It is commonly thought that Ešarra-ḫammat was his mother, despite the complete lack of direct evidence; the Assyrian queen is also believed to be the mother of Ashurbanipal’s older brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn.    Ashurbanipal’s name appears as  ʾsnpr  (Asnappar) in the Bible (Erza 4:10),  srbnbl  (Sarbanabal) in an Aramaic tale written in Demotic script, and Σαρδαναπαλ(λ)οϛ (Sardanapal(l)us) in Greek and Latin sources. A document from Nineveh written ca. 670 (83-1-18,231) seems to imply that giving the name of the reigning king Ashurbanipal (or the former king Sennacherib) to a commoner was considered taboo, a sacrilege punishable by the river ordeal; see Kataja, SAAB 1 (1987) pp. 65–68.       4  Grayson, Chronicles p. 86 no. 1 iv 33 and p. 127 no. 14 line 34´.       5  The exact length of Ashurbanipal’s reign is problematic. Scholars generally believe that he ruled over Assyria until 631, 630, or 627. Based on contemporary evidence, he was king up to at least Simānu (III) 631, but, according to an inscription of Nabonidus’ mother Adda-guppī (Schaudig, Inschriften Nabonids p. 503 no. 3.2 ex. 1 i 30), he reigned until 627. The issue has received a great deal of attention, but no scholarly consensus has yet been reached. See, for example, Naʾaman, ZA 81 (1991) pp. 243–267; Zawadzki, ZA 85 (1995) pp. 67–73; Beaulieu, Bagh. Mitt. 28 (1997) pp. 367–394; Gerber, ZA 88 (1998) pp. 72–93; Reade, Orientalia NS 67 (1998) pp. 255–265; Oelsner, Studies Renger pp. 643–666; Liebig, ZA 90 (2000) pp. 281–284; and Fuchs, Studies Oelsner pp. 25–28 and 35. It is assumed in this publication that he died, abdicated, or was deposed in 631. The matter will be addressed in the introduction of Part 2."

      "text": "Numerous royal inscriptions of Ashurbanipal have been recovered and most of these are housed in museum collections and private collections around the world; the British Museum (London) and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago contain the bulk of these texts. Some stone objects of his that were discovered by R. Campbell Thompson in the 1920s and 30s were left in the field and reburied after being copied; some of these were duplicates of better preserved inscriptions, while others were deemed unsuitable for transport back to London (presumably because they were heavy and/or badly damaged). Clay and stone objects bearing Ashurbanipal's name originate from a broad geographic area, with most coming from the Assyrian heartland (Nineveh and Kalḫu) and northern Babylonia (Babylon and Nippur). The present corpus comprises excavated objects and objects purchased from local dealers.     Because of the huge number of texts and the sheer length of some of the compositions (a few of which are over 1,300 lines long), the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal are edited in two volumes. The division of the corpus is somewhat arbitrary as the authors have tried to maintain, to the best of their ability, a balance between Part 1 and Part 2 by including major, well-preserved inscriptions in both volumes. The present publication includes all historical inscriptions on clay prisms, clay cylinders, and wall slabs and other stone objects from Nineveh, Aššur, and Kalḫu, while the second part will include the texts of Ashurbanipal preserved on clay tablets and all of his Babylonian inscriptions, as well as the royal compositions of Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarra-iškun. A major portion of Part 1 (nos. 1–23) corresponds to Borger, Beiträge zum Inschriftenwerk Assurbanipals: die Prismenklassen A, B, C = K, D, E, F, G, H, J und T sowie andere Inschriften pp. 1–296; the historical texts written on tablets, however, are excluded here, as they will be included in Part 2. The inscriptions are arranged by object type (prisms, cylinders, then stone slabs, etc.) and, when possible, chronologically from earliest to latest. This generally follows the presentation of texts in Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/1–2 and Leichty, RINAP 4.    Most of the inscriptions included in Part 1 originate from Nineveh; text nos. 7 (Prism Kh), 12 (Prism H), and 13 (Prism J) are from Kalḫu (Biblical Calah) and Babylon. A few prism fragments were discovered at Aššur and all of these are inscribed with copies of text no. 9 (Prism F), a well-known inscription from Nineveh recording work on the House of Succession. [6]   There is also a stone tablet (text no. 61) that comes from Aššur.          Notes        6  These are text no. 9 (Prism F) exs. 206–210."

[7]    This versatile medium, which was perfect for composing lengthy texts, was without a doubt this king's preferred choice of foundation document in Assyria, just as it was for his father and grandfather; in Babylonia, however, clay (barrel) cylinders were the desired medium. Ashurbanipal's scribes tailored the shapes and sizes of prisms to match the length of the texts written on them. Shorter texts were often inscribed on pentagonal and hexagonal prisms, with each column accommodating 40–75 lines; medium-length inscriptions were generally written on octagonal prisms, with approximately 90–100 lines per column; and long compositions were frequently written on decagonal prisms, with columns containing around 130 lines each. Heptagonal and nonagonal prisms were also used.     At present, prisms bearing inscriptions of Ashurbanipal are attested for ca. 666–664, 649–644/643/642, and 639–ca. 638. [8]    It is assumed here that texts of his were also written on prisms in the years 663–650 and 643–640, as well as after 638. [9]    Most of the known pieces were discovered at Nineveh, but a few were found at Aššur, Babylon, and Kalḫu. Based on their building reports, as well as their find spots, these foundation documents were deposited (or displayed) in Ashurbanipal's palace (the House of Succession, the North Palace), the armory, the citadel wall, the Sîn-Šamaš temple, and one of the two akītu-houses of Ištar at Nineveh; in the Nabû temple (Ezida) at Kalḫu; and in temples of Lugaldimmeranki (Duku) and Gula (Esabad) at Babylon. [10]    Many of the pieces from Nineveh were not found in situ, but were discovered in Area SH (“Sennacherib's House”) — which is near the city wall, about 500 m north of Kuyunjik — or were purchased from a dealer in Mosul. [11]       The contents of Ashurbanipal's prism inscriptions provide us with a wealth of information about many of his accomplishments. These royal compositions, as A.K. Grayson has noted, “are commonly called ‘annals' but which are really a curious combination of the annalistic form and the ‘display' form” and these texts “are rather like small historical novels and have behind them a complex textual history.” [12]    For the modern historian, these texts are somewhat problematic since they present the narrative of events geographically, rather than chronologically, regularly give the campaigns different numbers, [13]   depending on their position within the narrative, and provide neither eponyms nor regnal years for the events recorded. Furthermore, one “campaign” (Akk.  gerru ) could include descriptions of several military expeditions and/or could provide conflicting pieces of information, [14]   as well as later supplements that included details about the fates of the king's rivals. The geographical arrangement of the “military narration” in Ashurbanipal's annalistic texts, which follows the model established by his father Esarhaddon, was established very early in his reign. [15]   Scribes described this king's accomplishments generally in a clockwise direction, beginning with Egypt, and then continuing with the Levant and Anatolia, Qirbit, Mannea, Media, and Elam, Babylonia, and Gambulu, and concluding with Arabia.     Ashurbanipal's prism inscriptions fall into three broad categories: (1) building inscriptions; (2) annalistic texts; and (3) summary inscriptions. As far as the corpus is preserved, annalistic texts are the most common; text nos. 1–4, 6–11, 14–17, and probably 18–19 fall into this category. Building inscriptions and summary inscriptions, on the other hand, are far less common; text no. 5 falls into the former group, while text nos. 12–13, and probably text nos. 16 and 20, belong to the latter. There is a great deal of diversity within each category of text, at least for the annalistic texts.     Annalistic texts, which are often referred to in scholarly literature (including this volume) as ‘annals' (which is not the case in the strictest sense) or res gestae (lit. “[royal] deeds,” as labeled by the Roman emperor Augustus), are the most common type of royal composition written on prisms [16]   and, therefore, the best known texts. [17]   The style and contents of Ashurbanipal's annals vary, depending on when they were written and where they were intended to be deposited (or displayed). Early annalistic texts — for example, text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂) — contain lengthy prologues, a detailed résumé of accomplishments (including both victories on the battlefield and the voluntary sending of gifts by foreign rulers), [18]   a building report, concluding formulae, and a date. The introductions of these early annals, unlike those in later inscriptions, record some of the details of Ashurbanipal's education, including his ability to recognize and discuss celestial and terrestrial portents, to solve mathematical calculations, and to read ancient and obscure texts written in both Akkadian and Sumerian. [19]   Moreover, these same inscriptions do not assign numbers to the king's campaigns; this feature was first used sometime between 663 and 649. [20]   This style of annals — but without information on Ashurbanipal's “school days” and with more details about the restoration and decoration of temples and the sequential numbering of campaigns — is also known for inscriptions composed during Ashurbanipal's 22nd (647) and 23rd (646) years on the throne; these are text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G). [21]   For example, text no. 7 (Prism Kh) contains: (1) a prologue that records work undertaken in five Assyrian cities (Aššur, Arbela, Ḫarrān, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu) and two Babylonian cities (Babylon and Borsippa); (2) reports of campaigns against Egypt, Tyre, Qirbit, Mannea, Media, Elam, Babylonia, the Gambulu, and various Arab tribes; (3) an account of the renovation of the Nabû temple (Ezida) in Kalḫu; (4) concluding formulae; and (5) a date. Other versions of Ashurbanipal's annals — text nos. 3 (Prism B), 4 (Prism D), 9 (Prism F), and 11 (Prism A) — were less interested in the king's off-the-battlefield accomplishments, especially his building activities, and those inscriptions had short prologues. For example, the introduction to text no. 11 (Prism A) records a few pieces of information about his nomination as heir designate of Assyria and training in the House of Succession and states that Assyria had agricultural prosperity during his reign. With regard to the building reports, they describe work on city walls, palaces (royal residences and armories), and temples; for example, text nos. 1 (Prism E₁), 9 (Prism F), and 11 (Prism A) contained accounts of the construction of the House of Succession (the North Palace at Nineveh), while text no. 10 (Prism T) included a description of the rebuilding of one of the akītu-houses at Nineveh.    Only one building inscription of Ashurbanipal written on prisms is known today: this is text no. 5 (Prism I). [22]   That inscription consists of a lengthy prologue, which records several building projects in Assyria and Babylonia, [23]   an account of the rebuilding of the Sîn-Šamaš temple at Nineveh, concluding formulae, and a date. Presumably, similar inscriptions must have existed in Assyria in antiquity.    Summary inscriptions are attested for the first time in Ashurbanipal's 30th regnal year (638), beginning with text no. 12 (Prism H). It is uncertain exactly when this king's scribes shifted from writing annalistic texts to summary inscriptions since there is a break in the textual record between 644 (643 or 642) and 639. The few texts of this sub-genre of royal composition that we do have are unfortunately badly damaged. Nevertheless, text nos. 12 (Prism H) and 13 (Prism J) are sufficiently preserved to be able to get a sense of what information these types of texts included. Ashurbanipal's summary inscriptions contain a lengthy prologue that records the renovation and decoration of temples and shrines, a long résumé of successes on the battlefield, passages stating that various foreign rulers (voluntarily) sent gifts and messengers bearing messages of goodwill, a building report, concluding formulae, and a date. The military narration abandons the numbering of campaigns and records the events one after another; the episodes are occasionally separated by a horizontal ruling. The arrangement of the episodes, at least for the events that took place before 644 (or 643), follows that of the earlier annalistic texts. Events that happened after the composition of text no. 11 (Prism A) — for example, the receipt of audience gifts from Cyrus I of Parsumaš (Persia) and Pislumê of Ḫudimiri, and Tugdammî the Cimmerian's failed attempts to invade Assyria and the tragedies that befell him — are placed at the end of the military narration. As for the building reports, those of the two known summary inscriptions on prisms are different from those of annalistic texts in that they describe building activities in Babylonia, rather than in Assyria; this is not unexpected since text no. 12 (Prism H) exs. 1–2 and text no. 13 (Prism J) ex. 5 were found at Babylon. [24]   This type of text was also written on clay cylinders and undecorated stone wall slabs.      Clay Vertical Cylinders    This medium, which is the perfect blend of a prism and a cylinder, as far as the textual record is preserved, was used only once — namely, to write out some copies of text no. 9 (Prism F). Vertical cylinders use both the smooth, rounded surface of cylinders and the long, multi-column format of prisms. Much like Tiglath-pileser I's attempt to introduce clay prisms as a medium for writing out long annalistic texts, Ashurbanipal's attempt to introduce vertical cylinders seems to have been a short-lived experiment, which was apparently limited to a single inscription. [25]        Clay Cylinders    Unlike in Babylonia, the clay cylinder appears not to have been a commonly used medium for royal inscriptions in Assyria during the reign of Ashurbanipal. [26]   Presently, fragments of only one cylinder bearing a text of this king from Nineveh have survived: this is text no. 21. [27]   Apart from the fact that text no. 21 is a summary inscription that provides a very cursory résumé of the accomplishments of the first thirty years of his reign (668–ca. 639), very little can be said about the use of this medium in Assyria. It is certain from this text that Ashurbanipal's scribes sometimes chose to use cylinders to write out royal inscriptions towards the end of his reign.       Wall Slabs (with and without Reliefs)   Ashurbanipal had his scribes write out long narrative texts for undecorated wall slabs; inscriptions of the ninth-century ruler Ashurnasirpal II (883–859) in the Ištar temple at Nineveh (Emašmaš) may have served as a model. This medium, as far as we know, was not used for annals and summary inscriptions during the reigns of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon, but it was used by Ashurbanipal on at least one occasion: when he when he had Emašmaš rebuilt and enlarged late in his reign (ca. 643–638). Two lengthy narrative inscriptions are preserved on a series of wall slabs: text nos. 22 and 23 (Inscription from the Ištar temple; hereafter IIT). Both, unfortunately, are badly damaged. The earlier of the two, text no. 22, which may have been composed ca. 640, appears to be an abbreviated version of the king's annals; the composition was written in no less than four columns. [28]   The later inscription, text no. 23 (IIT), which was written no earlier than 638, is a summary inscription; the complete text was written in two columns. [29]   Both inscriptions have long prologues that commemorate the renovation and decoration of numerous Assyrian and Babylonian temples and building reports that describe work on the Ištar temple at Nineveh. [30]      Numerous sculpted limestone slabs that once lined the walls of the North Palace and South-West Palace at Nineveh contained epigraphs, short inscriptions and labels that accompanied images of war and hunting. Thirty-five of these have survived; eight come from Room XXXIII of Sennacherib's “Palace Without a Rival” and twenty-five were discovered in various rooms of Ashurbanipal's own palace (North Palace Rooms F, I, M, S¹, and V¹/T¹), while two could come from either palace. [31]   These epigraphs provide information about: (1) the war against Aḫšēri of Mannea; (2) the defeat of Teumman at Tīl-Tūba; (3) the flaying of two high profile Gambulian rebels; (4) the capture of Babylon after the death of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn; (4) the defeat of Ummanigaš; (5) the capture and looting of Elamite cities during Ashurbanipal's wars with Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III); (6) the capture of Ummanaldašu; (7) the looting of the city Bīt-Luppi; and (8) two successful lion hunts, one that took place out in the open steppe and one that was staged on the outskirts of Nineveh. In addition, there are drafts of approximately seventy-five other epigraphs that are known only from clay tablets. Most of those deal with the campaigns of 653 (Teumman and Dunānu) and the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion. These will be included in RINAP 5/2 and further details on these epigraph collections will be provided in the introduction of that volume.    The back, wall-facing surface of a stone slab discovered in the ruins of the armory at Nebi Yunus by Iraqi archeologists in the early 1990s is inscribed with a proprietary label of Ashurbanipal. [32]   This text is similar in style to the Palace Inscriptions of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon. [33]   Presumably, many of the slabs lining the walls of the armory renovated by Ashurbanipal were inscribed with the same short, four-line text.       Paving Stones   Sometime around the years 643–640, Ashurbanipal had the courtyards of Ezida and Emašmaš, the temples of Nabû and Ištar at Nineveh, enlarged. Their floors were paved with inscribed square-shaped stone slabs; the texts were laid face down so that the uninscribed surface faced upwards. [34]   The stones used in Ezida were dedicated to Nabû, while those placed in Emašmaš were dedicated to Ištar/Mullissu. [35]   Apart from stating that the Assyrian king had the courtyards of those two temples enlarged, the inscriptions record that Ashurbanipal had the head of the Elamite king Teumman cut off and that he had other deposed and captured Elamite kings (including Tammarītu and Ummanaldašu) hitched to his chariot as if they were horses. Both texts conclude with petitions to allow Ashurbanipal to reach extreme old age.      Stone Tablet    One stone tablet of Ashurbanipal survives today. [36]   It was found at Aššur, in a secondary context (being used as a door socket), and it commemorates renovations made to the wall of that city, as well as records the restoration of Esagil at Babylon, the return of Marduk's statue from Baltil (Aššur) to Babylon, and the dedication of a ceremonial chariot and a bed to Marduk and his consort Zarpanītu. [37]   The tablet — which had probably been deposited in the structure of the wall of Aššur — is dated to the eponymy of Awiānu, governor of the land Que (655).       Lapis Lazuli Tablet    A small lapis lazuli tablet, which may have been used as an amulet, was discovered by Campbell Thompson at Nineveh (1905). [38]   Its apotropaic function is inferred from the dedicatory inscription written on it; based on the preserved epithets, the text appears to have been dedicated to Marduk.      Anthropomorphic Statues    Several inscriptions record that Ashurbanipal had images of himself made from metal and installed before the gods in their temples. [39]   It is certain from a small fragment of a colossal pink limestone statue that the king also had anthropomorphic statues of himself made from stone and that he had brief inscriptions engraved on them (on one of their shoulders). [40]   The one known statue of Ashurbanipal found at Nineveh was commissioned by Ashurbanipal ca. late 653–early 652 since the text written on it mentions that the statue was made (shortly) after the Elamite king Teumman was defeated.      Stone Bull Colossi    The wall-facing surface of a human-headed bull colossus discovered in a wing of the armory at Nebi Yunus constructed by Esarhaddon bears a short, four-line proprietary label. [41]   The inscription is the same one that was engraved on the back of at least one wall slab (see above) and it was presumably written on the back of other bull colossi erected in the gateways of that building. This bull colossus, which was discovered by the Iraqis in the early 1990s, is the only one known from the reign of Ashurbanipal and it, together with a single wall slab, are the only physical proof of the armory's renovation by Ashurbanipal. [42]         Seals    Four stamp seals of Ashurbanipal are known from thirty-five impressions on clay bullae found at Nineveh. [43]   The actual seals themselves have been lost, are in private collections, or remain buried in Iraq. The proprietary label of three of the seals is engraved in a single line, while that of the fourth seal is written over four lines.       Stone Vessels    Numerous stone vessels are inscribed with a one-line proprietary inscription stating that the objects belonged to Ashurbanipal. [44]   Most come from Nineveh, but one was discovered at Aššur. Some of the exemplars of text no. 68 have images of a table and a lion incised to the left of the inscription. In the repertoire of Assyrian hieroglyphs, the lion represents the king and, thus, these vessels were probably used to serve Ashurbanipal's meals, that is, objects used specifically for “the king's table” (TABLE + LION). [45]        Glazed Bricks    A single glazed brick contains a three-word inscription that states that the Assyrian king was “[the one who bro]ught about the defeat of [the land] Elam.” [46]   Presumably, this brick formed part of a much longer inscription, which no longer exists. Given the near complete lack of evidence, little can be said at this time about glazed-brick inscriptions of Ashurbanipal.        Notes       7   Due to a significant gap in the textual record in Assyria from 669 to ca. 666, it is not known whether this Assyrian king had his annalistic texts first inscribed on clay (barrel) cylinders and then later on prisms, like his grandfather Sennacherib (and his father Esarhaddon), or whether he first used clay tablets and then transitioned to clay prisms.       8   The dates for text nos. 1 (Prism E₁), 2 (Prism E₂), 11 (Prism A), and 13 (Prism J) are uncertain. Text no. 1 (Prism E₁) may have been written ca. 666–665; text no. 2 (Prism E₂) was likely composed ca. 665–664; text no. 11 (Prism A) was either written in 644, 643, or 642; and text no. 13 (Prism J) was written no earlier than 638. For the date of text no. 11 (Prism A), which was inscribed on prisms during the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni, see the Dating and Chronology section below.       9   For example, text no. 15 is probably an inscription written between 663 and 649; it may have been written before 655. For details, see the commentary to that text; Weissert and Onasch, Orientalia NS 61 (1992) p. 73 n. 46; and Novotny, Orientalia NS 72 (2003) pp. 211–214. The dates of text nos. 14 and 18 are unknown and it is possible that one of those two inscriptions may have been written between 644 (643 or 642) and 639. Moreover, there is a slight possibility that text no. 16 was composed ca. 652–650; see Novotny, ibid. It is unclear how long after Ashurbanipal's 31st regnal year (638) inscriptions continued to be written. It is likely, although it cannot be proven, that official texts were written in his name until the end of his reign, 631 at the earliest and 627 at the latest.        10   Few prisms of Ashurbanipal have been found in situ. Text no. 3 (Prism B) ex. 1 is reported to have been discovered in the North Palace at Nineveh by H. Rassam; this purported find spot is doubtful if its now-missing building report recorded work on the armory since one would expect that this prism had come from Nebi Yunus instead. Many of the exemplars of text no. 7 (Prism Kh) were found in the debris of the collapsed walls of the Nabû temple at Kalḫu. Text no. 10 (Prism T) ex. 1 was used as fill in the Ezida temple at Nineveh; this prism, which appears to have been broken in antiquity, should have been deposited in one of Ištar's  akītu -houses at Nineveh. Text no. 11 (Prism A) exs. 1–2 were found in the structure of the North Palace; the former came from one of the walls of Room H.        11   For details about the cache of texts from Area SH and the prism fragments purchased by E. Chiera in 1928, see in particular Thompson and Hutchinson, CEN p. 83; Piepkorn, Asb. pp. 2–3 and n. 12; Reade, CRRA 30 p. 216; Cogan and Tadmor, JCS 40 (1988) pp. 84–85; and Reade, RLA 9/5–6 (2000) p. 420 §15.4.        12   Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 142.        13   For example, in some inscriptions, the second campaign to Egypt is not assigned a campaign number, while in others it is either referred to as the first or second campaign; compare text nos. 3–4 and 6–8 to text nos. 9 and 11.       14   It is sometimes unclear who actually led the Assyrian army into battle, the king or one of his generals.       15   This is in contrast to the annalistic texts of other Assyrian kings, especially Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, and Sennacherib, all of whose annals narrate events chronologically.       16   The same can be said for the inscriptions of Sargon II, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon.       17   The modern designations of most of Ashurbanipal's annals follow those used by R. Borger in BIWA, but with one exception: Borger's Prism CKalach/CND has been renamed Prism Kh (following Novotny, SAOC 62 p. 129). Text nos. 1–4 and 6–11 are Prism E₁, E₂, B, D, C, Kh, G, F, T, and A respectively.       18   One inscription even included a report about the hunting of a pride of lions in the vicinity of Arbela. See text no. 14.       19   Little of the prologues of text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂) is preserved, but the bulk of their contents can be reconstructed with some degree of certainty from the prologue of the so-called Ashurbanipal's School Days Inscription (also known as the L[ondon] 4  Inscription); see Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 77–78 no. 18 i 1–ii 25'. This volume assumes that the prologues of these two prism inscriptions more or less contained the same information as Ashurbanipal's School Days Inscription.       20   Text no. 3 (Prism B) is the earliest extant annalistic inscription of Ashurbanipal in which campaigns are assigned numbers. Copies of that text were written during the eponymies of Aḫu-ilāʾī (649) and Bēlšunu (648). It is assumed here that scribes began assigning campaign numbers in the king's annals long before Ashurbanipal's 20th regnal year. Given the long gap in the textual record between text no. 2 (Prism E2) and text no. 3 (Prism B), it is not possible to be certain when this change took place. Few Assyrian inscriptions of Ashurbanipal from 663 to 650 have been positively identified. It is possible that some of the uncertain exemplars edited with text no. 3 (Prism B), exs. 1*–147*, preserve parts of inscriptions written after 664 and before 649. Text no. 15 was most likely written during this time, perhaps before 655.       21   Text no. 10 (Prism T) is a variation of this type of inscription. Instead of having lengthy military narration, this text includes an abbreviated report of a single campaign.        22   This inscription is referred to as “Prism TVar” in Borger, BIWA (pp. 134–136). The designation “Prism I” follows Novotny, Studies Walker p. 192 n. 6.       23   The prologue is identical to those of text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G).       24   As is fairly certain from the concluding formulae, the building report of text no. 12 (Prism H) would have recorded the restoration of the Gula temple Esabad at Babylon. The building account of text no. 13 (Prism J) ex. 5 describes the renovation of Marduk's  akītu -house at Babylon. However, the Nineveh version of text no. 13 (Prism J), which is known from exs. 1–4, likely contained a description of some project at Nineveh.       25   The known vertical cylinders are text no. 9 (Prism F) exs. 7, 29, 32, 35–36, 57, 96, 146–147, 154, 160–161, 164, 172, and 204. Prior to the reign of Sargon II (721–705), only one Assyrian royal inscription was written on clay prisms: this is the now-famous annals of Tiglath-pileser I (Grayson, RIMA 2 pp. 7–31 A.0.87.1). Sargon's scribes appear to have reintroduced this medium during the second half of his reign. Between 1076 and 721, clay tablets were the primary choice of foundation document used by Assyrian kings.        26   For his Babylonian inscriptions on cylinders, see Frame, RIMB 2 pp. 196–198, 202–208, 212–216, 219–221, and 224–228 B.6.32.1, 3–6, 12–13, 15, and 19–20. These will be included in Part 2. It is unknown if cylinders were used as foundation documents in Assyria from 668 to early 666 since few texts of Ashurbanipal are extant from his first decade on the throne. It is possible that some of his early inscriptions were written on this medium, just as it was during the early reigns of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon. Alternatively, as suggested by multiple copies of the so-called Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription (Novotny, SAACT 10 no. 20), early annalistic texts and summary inscriptions may have been written on clay tablets.       27   A.R. Millard (Iraq 30 [1968] p. 111) suggested that BM 122613 belongs to Ashurbanipal. Following E. Weissert ( apud  Borger, BIWA p. 356), the authors believe that that piece actually contains an inscription of Sîn-šarra-iškun.        28   Only a small portion of text no. 22 survives today and pieces of it are housed in the Hearst Museum of Anthropology of University of California at Berkeley, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Vorderasiatisches Museum. The prologue, as far as it is preserved, most closely duplicates text no. 12 (Prism H) and the military narration, what little of it survives, abbreviates material included in text no. 11 (Prism A).       29   The inscription is known from approximately one hundred limestone fragments that were discovered during the 1930–31 British Museum excavations of the Kuyunjik mound under the direction of R. Campbell Thompson. All but one of these pieces are known only from Campbell Thompson's copies. Despite earlier claims that the IIT was set up in triplicate, there were at least four copies of this monumental inscription lining the walls of Ištar's temple; for details, see Fuchs in Borger, BIWA p. 259 and see the introduction and commentary of text no. 23 (IIT).       30   The building report of text no. 22 is not preserved, but based on the inscription's concluding formulae it is conjectured that the slabs with this text once lined the walls of Emašmaš at Nineveh and recorded that temple's renovation in its building account. See Frame in Spar and Jursa, CTMMA 4 p. 274.       31   Text nos. 25–28 and 33–36 come from the South-West Palace, text nos. 24, 29–30, and 37–58 come from the North Palace, and text nos. 31–32 could belong to either palace. See Gerardi, JCS 40 (1988) pp. 1–35; Borger, BIWA pp. 297–319; and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 154–209.       32   Text no. 64 ex. 2.        33   Compare Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/2 pp. 123–125 no. 80; and Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 67–69 nos. 20–22. The scribes of Sargon II also carved inscriptions on the back of most (if not all) of the king's palace wall slabs, but these inscriptions are much longer (and more poorly written) than those of his successors (see J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 101–103).       34   Text nos. 59 (Nabû Inscription) and 60 (Mullissu Inscription).        35   The goddess Mullissu, Aššur's consort, had a cult at Nineveh in the Ištar temple (Emašmaš) during the second half of Ashurbanipal's reign. Starting around 645, at least according to a few of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, Mullissu appears to have supplanted Ištar as the main occupant of Emašmaš. This is evident from text no. 10 (Prism T) v 33–vi 51; text no. 11 (Prism A) x 17–39; text no. 23 (IIT) lines 1–13a, 30–37a, and 162–183; and text no. 60 (Mullissu Inscription). Ištar does not seem to have been entirely booted out of her seat in Nineveh. For example, text no. 60 (Mullissu Inscription) line 12 still refers to the Emašmaš as “the temple of the goddess Ištar.”       36   Text no. 61.        37   According to the subscript on K 2411 (Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/2 p. 231 no. 162 iii 36'–40'), the bed was returned to Babylon on the 27th of Simānu (III) of the eponymy of Awiānu (655). For further details, see n. 194.       38   Text no. 62.       39   See, for example, text no. 10 (Prism T) iii 49b–iv 3.        40  Text no. 63.        41   Text no. 64 ex. 1. Sargon II's scribes also carved inscriptions on the wall-facing side of his bull colossi (see J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall pp. 101–103).       42   The building reports of text no. 3 (Prism B), and probably that of text no. 6 (Prism C), provide the textual evidence.        43  Text nos. 65–67.       44   Text nos. 68–70.       45   For further details and bibliography on Assyrian hieroglyphs, see Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 238–243 no. 115; Nadali, Iraq 70 (2008) pp. 87–104; and Niederreiter, Iraq 70 (2008) pp. 51–86       46   Text no. 71. For some information on glazed bricks, see in particular Nadali, Iraq 70 (2008) pp. 87–104; and Nadali in Encyclopaedia of the History of Science 3  pp. 978–981."

      "text": "Just like many of the other late Neo-Assyrian rulers, Ashurbanipal has been a popular subject of study from the early days of Assyriology and, therefore, it is little surprise that there are numerous books, dissertations, and articles devoted to him, his inscriptions, and his reign.  [47]   From the 1860s and 70s to the present, numerous works, large and small, have been devoted to Assyria's last great king. Because this is not the place to present a complete and detailed historical survey of the publication of the Ashurbanipal corpus, or to provide a complete bibliographical study of this king, we will focus on previous editions (and translations) and major studies of the corpus that have advanced our knowledge of this king's royal inscriptions. Extensive bibliographies are provided for each text.    Treatments of Ashurbanipal and his reign are to be found in every general history of Assyria or Mesopotamia. Particularly useful are the biographical sketches by Grayson in CAH 2  3/2; Radner, Ruby, and Weissert in PNA 1/1 pp. 159–171 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli; and Arnaud, Assurbanipal. Translations of selected inscriptions of his often appear in collected works of Mesopotamian texts in translation, for example, Oppenheim in ANET 2  and Borger in TUAT 1/4.     Before discussing previous editions and major studies of this text corpus, we would like to cite here other works in which Ashurbanipal texts have been published. For copies, typeset Neo-Assyrian or hand-drawn facsimiles, see in particular: Layard, ICC; 1 R; 2 R; 3 R; 5 R; Lehmann-Haupt, Šamaššumukîn; Winckler, Sammlung 3; Ungnad, VAS 1; Scheil, Prisme; King, CT 34; Leeper, CT 35; Thompson, Arch. 79 (1929); Bauer, Asb.; Thompson, Iraq 7 (1940); Wiseman, Iraq 13 (1951); Knudsen, Iraq 29 (1967); Millard, Iraq 30 (1968); Mahmud and Black, Sumer 44 (1985–86); and Marzahn, FuB 27 (1989). For editions/transliterations of a single text, or a very small group of texts, often accompanied by a copy and/or a photograph, see especially: Weidner, AfO 7 (1931–32); Thompson, AAA 20 (1933); Thompson, Esar.; Aynard, Prisme; Borger, JCS 19 (1965); Weippert, Edom; Freedman, St. Louis; Cogan and Tadmor, Orientalia NS 46 (1977); Borger, BAL 2 ; Walker, CBI; Gerardi, JCS 40 (1988); Weissert and Onasch, Orientalia NS 61 (1992); Onasch, ÄAT 27; J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall; Novotny, Eḫulḫul; Novotny, Orientalia NS 74 (2005); Novotny, SAAB 15 (2006); Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels; and Novotny, SAACT 10. Information on objects containing inscriptions of Ashurbanipal is provided in a few museum and excavation catalogues. The most useful of these are: Bezold, Cat. 1–4; King, Cat.; Lambert and Millard, Cat.; and Lambert, Cat.; and Cogan and Tadmor, JCS 40 (1988) pp. 87–96. The catalogue of texts provided in Borger, BIWA pp. 320–388 is also very useful.    In 1871, G. Smith's History of Assurbanipal, Translated from the Cuneiform Inscriptions was the first book dedicated entirely to Ashurbanipal's life and texts. Work on the volume began in 1866 and, to some extent, was prepared in conjunction with The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, vol. 3: A Selection from the Miscellaneous Inscriptions of Assyria (= 3 R), a volume published by Sir H. Rawlinson with the assistance of Smith. The cost of publishing this 384-page tome was generously covered by J. W. Bosanquet, a well-known chronologist, and H. Fox Talbot, one of the early pioneers whose efforts greatly advanced the decipherment of Akkadian cuneiform. The original Ashurbanipal cuneiform sources used by Smith included editions (and very general studies) of the prisms (which he calls “cylinders”), tablets, and epigraphs published by him in 3 R, as well as a few other royal inscriptions and Neo-Assyrian letters. Although thirty-six inscriptions were used, the editions of Prisms A, B, C, D, and E (text nos. 11, 3, 6, 4, and 1–2 respectively) formed the backbone of Smith's “history.”  [48]   The texts themselves were edited passage by passage (prologue, first campaign, etc.), with the master text appearing in typeset Neo-Assyrian cuneiform, beneath which appeared the corresponding transliteration and English translation. Occasionally minor variants were cited and some major variants were edited after the master text. [49]      J. Ménant, in 1874, published French translations of the Ashurbanipal inscriptions published by G. Smith, as well as a short brick inscription of Aššur-etel-ilāni. [50]      In 1887 and 1889, S.A. Smith took it upon himself to publish a collection of texts dating to Ashurbanipal's reign. The three-volume Die Keilschrifttexte Asurbanipals, Königs von Assyrien (668–626 c. Chr.) contained a full treatment of Rm 1 — the so-called Rassam Prism (text no. 11 [Prism A] ex. 1), a hand-drawn facsimile of which T.G. Pinches had published several years earlier in The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, vol. 5: A Selection from the Miscellaneous Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia (= 5 R) — editions (transliterations and German translations) of a few royal inscriptions and numerous (about thirty) Neo-Assyrian letters. [51]   Typeset Neo-Assyrian copies of previously unpublished texts accompanied the editions, commentaries, and glossaries. Die Keilschrifttext Asurbanipals represents the first major German publication dealing with this Assyrian king.    In 1890, in a volume of Neo-Assyrian historical texts edited by E. Schrader (KB 2), P. Jensen published editions of a handful of inscriptions of Ashurbanipal. These included the texts known to him, those published in 2 R; 3 R; 5 R; G. Smith, Assurbanipal; and S.A. Smith, Keilschrifttexte 1–2. [52]       H. Winckler, in 1895, published annotated copies of thirty inscribed objects of Ashurbanipal in the third volume of his three-part Sammlung von Keilschrifttexten. The principal contents were a moderately revised version of Rm 1 (text no. 11 [Prism A] ex. 1), [53]   which Pinches had published in 1880 (5 R), and more accurate copies of the principal exemplars of Prisms B (text no. 3) and D (text no. 4) than the ones given by G. Smith in 3 R; this marked a departure from the publication of composite texts.    One of the most important scholarly works on Ashurbanipal was published by M. Streck in 1916 in his impressive three-volume Assurbanipal und die letzten assyrischen Könige bis zum Untergange Niniveh's. [54]   This excellent piece of scholarship brought together the then-known material and produced a high-quality study of the lives and reigns of the last kings of the Assyrian empire, as well as annotated editions of the available inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Aššur-etel-ilāni, and Sîn-šarra-iškun. Volume 1 provided a comprehensive introduction to the extant corpus of inscriptions (with relevant bibliography), contemporary textual sources (letters, archival documents, “religious texts,” etc.) that gave insight into the reigns of Ashurbanipal and his successors, and the (political and building) history of Assyria from the death of Esarhaddon to the fall of Nineveh. Chapter 4 (Zur Geschichte Assyriens vom Tode Assarhaddons bis zum Untergange Ninevehs) tackled many complex issues, including the problems of internal chronology, and it was the first critical study of this important period of Assyrian history. [55]   Volume 2 contained the editions (transliterations and German translations) of the then-known corpus of inscriptions of Assyria's last kings, which included: five versions of the annals written on prisms (Prisms A–E); twenty-two annalistic texts written on clay tablets; fourteen “display inscriptions” written on cylinders, tablets, and steles; sixteen epigraphs written on sculpted wall slabs; drafts of epigraphs inscribed on nine clay tablets; a literary text (a dialogue between Ashurbanipal and the god Nabû); three brick inscriptions (two from Babylon and one from Nippur); a building inscription from Nippur; twenty-two colophons known from tablets found in Ashurbanipal's libraries; an inscription of Aššur-etel-ilāni; two texts of Sîn-šarra-iškun; and a stele inscription of Ashurbanipal's wife Libbāli-šarrat. [56]   Volume 3 included complete glossaries of Akkadian words, logograms, and proper names, as well as supplemental information on texts that had been published in 1914. [57]   Streck's  magnum opus , despite being extremely outdated, remains to this day one of the most important principal scholarly resources for the study of Ashurbanipal and his successors.    In 1927, D.D. Luckenbill included translations of the then-published Ashurbanipal texts in his Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia (vol. 2), a two-volume set that comprised English translations of the entire corpus of Assyrian royal inscriptions available at that time. [58]   ARAB 2 included approximately seventy inscriptions written on prisms (which he calls “cylinders”), tablets, cylinders, paving stones, and steles. Luckenbill's work was based entirely on published material, most of which appeared a decade earlier in Streck, Asb.; the texts were not collated against the originals.    The year 1933 was a watershed for the study of Ashurbanipal. Two important volumes publishing a wealth of new sources appeared. The earliest was T. Bauer's two-volume Das Inschriftenwerk Assurbanipals vervollständigt und neu bearbeitet. The book was divided into two parts: the copies (Keilschrifttexte) and editions (Bearbeitung). Part 1 comprised 64 plates of hand-drawn facsimiles of approximately 170 (mostly previously unpublished) clay prisms and tablets housed in the British Museum (London). [59]   This greatly expanded the available corpus of texts, especially building and dedicatory inscriptions; the two most significant/largest pieces included were the fragmentarily preserved prisms BM 105315+ (text no. 9 [Prism F] ex. 2) and K 1794+ (text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 1). [60]   Part 2 contained editions (transliterations and German translations) of most of the inscriptions that Bauer had copied, together with relevant bibliography and some commentary. For the texts that were not copied or edited, [61]   Bauer often provided corrections and updated readings; these were the results of his firsthand re-examination of the originals in London. The numerous texts were grouped in three general categories: (1) building and dedication inscriptions; (2) unique texts; and (3) epigraphs. Contrary to the book's title (and its foreword), Das Inschriftenwerk Assurbanipals did not include the entire then-known corpus of inscriptions of this Assyrian king. Nevertheless, Bauer's work, especially Part 1 (Keilschrifttexte), proved itself to be a vital supplement to Streck, Asb. and it remains to this day the publication with the most copies of the inscribed objects of Ashurbanipal.     Shortly after Bauer, Asb. appeared, A.C. Piepkorn published the first part of his planned two-volume work on the texts of Assyria's last great king. Historical Prism Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal 1: Editions E, B 1–5 , D, and K (Assyriological Studies 5) made available many of the then-unpublished 243 prism fragments in the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, as well as a few pieces in his own possession. [62]   This new material, which included texts in the British Museum (London), in Piepkorn's own words “increased [Prism] E by two and a half times, giving us almost the entire text of [Prism]  B , provided valuable additions to [Prisms]  D  and  C , and permitted the reconstruction of [Prism]  F  down to a few signs.”  One hundred and forty-seven fragments were used to produce new, critical editions of the earliest four versions of Ashurbanipal's annals: Prisms E (text no. 1), B (text no. 3), D (text no. 4), and “K” (= C; text no. 6). [64]   One motive for Piepkorn's interest in the Ashurbanipal material, seems to have been to fix the poor editorial practices of earlier scholarship, which he found “somewhat less than satisfying.” He states that the purpose of his work was “(1) to provide all the available Assyrian historical prism inscriptions of Ashurbanipal in their correct, chronological sequence, as far as this sequence can be determined; (2) to assign the various published or otherwise available historical prism fragments to the proper edition in the degree to which our present knowledge makes this possible; [and] (3) to make available for historians the additional information contained in the Ashurbanipal fragments of the Oriental Institute.” [65]   The high quality of the editions was ensured by first-hand collation of the material, something that had been lacking in previous publications. Piepkorn's access to the unpublished Oriental Institute sources allowed him to make one very significant discovery: he recognized that Prism F, which was then known only from three fragments published by V. Scheil (= text no. 9 exs. 36, 44, and 48), and Bauer's Prism A a  (= text no. 9 ex. 2) were one and the same inscription. A second volume — one editing Prisms C (text no. 6), F 1–5  (text no. 9), and A (text no. 11), as well as a few other texts — was planned, but Piepkorn left Assyriology before completing the task and, thus, over half of the Ashurbanipal pieces in the Oriental Institute purchased by E. Chiera in 1928 remained unpublished. [66]      Between 1933 and 1995, no major publications editing the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal appeared. However, the same cannot be said about the publication of new texts and/or fragments discovered at Nineveh (1927–32) and Kalḫu (1950–56 and 1985). Copies of prism fragments from Nineveh were published by Campbell Thompson in “The British Museum Excavations at Nineveh, 1931-32,” Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology 20 (1933) pp. 71–113 and pls. LXXX–XCVII and “A Selection from the Cuneiform Historical Texts from Nineveh (1927-32),” Iraq 7 (1940) pp. 85–131 and figs. 1–20; and by A.R. Millard in “Fragments of Historical Texts from Nineveh: Ashurbanipal,” Iraq 30 (1968) pp. 98–111 and pls. XIX–XXVII. A catalogue of prisms of Ashurbanipal (as well as those of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon) found during Campbell Thompson's excavations was published in 1968 by W.G. Lambert and A.R. Millard in their Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum, 2nd Supplement. The material from Kalḫu was published by D.J. Wiseman in “Two Historical Inscriptions from Nimrud,” Iraq 13 (1951) pp. 21–26; E.E. Knudsen in “Fragments of Historical Texts from Nimrud: II,” Iraq 29 (1967) pp. 49–69 and pls. XIV–XXIX; and M. Mahmud and J. Black in “Recent Work in the Nabû Temple, Nimrud,” Sumer 44 (1985–86) pp. 137 and 151–152. A large prism fragment acquired by the Louvre in 1947 was published by J.-M. Aynard in 1957, in Le prisme du Louvre AO 19.939. In 1988, M. Cogan and H. Tadmor published a catalogue of the Ashurbanipal inscriptions in the Oriental Institute (Chicago) that were to have appeared in the follow-up volume to Piepkorn, Asb.; “Ashurbanipal Texts in the Collection of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago” (JCS 40 [1988] pp. 84–96) contained information on approximately 175 fragments, most of which were exemplars of Prism F (text no. 9). [67]   This new material more than doubled what had been available to Streck, Luckenbill, Bauer, and Piepkorn. However, the Oriental Institute pieces remained largely unpublished until 1996 (see below).    The influx of new sources generated some interest in improving our understanding of the Ashurbanipal corpus. R.D. Freedman, in his doctoral dissertation, The Cuneiform Tablets in St. Louis (Columbia University, 1975), produced a new edition of Prism C (text no. 6); that work utilized a few of the then-unpublished pieces that were in the personal collection of Piepkorn. [68]   Cogan, sometimes in cooperation with Tadmor, produced in the 1970s and 80s a series of articles devoted to the recensional history and editorial techniques of Ashurbanipal's scribes. The most important of these were: “Ashurbanipal Prism F: Notes on Scribal Techniques and Editorial Procedures,” JCS 29 (1977) pp. 97–107; “Gyges and Ashurbanipal: A Study in Literary Transmission,” Orientalia NS 46 (1977) pp. 65–85; and “Ashurbanipal's Conquest of Babylon: The First Official Report - Prism K,” Orientalia NS 50 (1981) pp. 229–240. In her 1987 dissertation from the University of Pennsylvania (Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns: A Literary and Political Study), P. Gerardi produced an excellent overview of this king's annalistic texts. [69]   In the early 1990s, H.-U. Onasch and E. Weissert devoted some attention to Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, especially on this king's Egyptian campaigns and his education. These two scholars produced one article on reassessing Prisms E₁ and E₂ (text nos. 1–2) (“The Prologue to Ashurbanipal's Prism E,” Orientalia NS 61 [1992] pp. 58–77). In addition, Onasch's published dissertation (Die assyrischen Eroberungen Ägyptens [ÄAT 27], 1994) produced new studies and editions of many texts reporting on Assyria's activities in Egypt during the reigns of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. [70]       G. Frame, in 1995, published editions of Ashurbanipal's Babylonian Inscriptions in Rulers of Babylonia: From the Second Dynasty of Isin to the End of Assyrian Domination (1157-612 BC) (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Babylonian Periods 2). This group of texts comprised twenty-three texts from Babylon, Borsippa, Dūr-Kurigalzu, Mê-Turran, Nippur, Sippar, and Uruk, as well as sixteen inscriptions written in the name of a loyal governor of Ur (Sîn-balāssu-iqbi). [71]   Following the strict editorial principals of the Toronto-based RIM Project (directed by Grayson), the collated (composite) transliterations were accompanied by readable English translations, short introductions, detailed catalogues of sources and commentaries, and extensive bibliographies. The high quality of the transliterations was ensured by collation of the texts from the originals (or from photographs); this was a marked improvement over earlier publications, some of which relied solely on published (not always accurate) hand-drawn copies.    The most comprehensive study and edition of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions was published by R. Borger in 1996. Beiträge zum Inschriftenwerk Assurbanipals: die Prismenklassen A, B, C = K, D, E, F, G, H, J und T sowie andere Inschriften (BIWA) was the fruitful product of research that began in 1988, when Borger started producing a critical edition of the Rassam Prism (text no. 11 [Prism A] ex. 1). It was obvious early on that what the field of Assyriology really needed were new editions of the complete corpus of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, something that would replace Streck's 1916 opus magnum. [72]   The monumental task of compiling and transliterating the vast source material began in 1989. Between 1989 and 1994, Borger transliterated (almost exclusively from the originals) all the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal that he could get access to in the British Museum (London) and the Oriental Institute (Chicago). His countless hours of carefully examining hundreds of clay prisms and tablets produced over 1,100 pages of hand-written notes, collations, and transliterations, as well as over 300 new joins (including many between pieces in Chicago and London). [73]   The heart of BIWA — the principal product of Borger's herculean efforts, which contribute significantly to the Ashurbanipal corpus — is its conflated and well-annotated editions of this king's prism inscriptions and related texts. [74]   Chapter I was primarily devoted to Prisms A and F; Chapter II to Prisms B and D; Chapter III to Prisms C, Kh, G, and T; Chapter IV to the E Prisms; Chapter V to Prisms H, J, and miscellaneous prism inscriptions; Chapter VI to translations; Chapter VII (which was prepared by A. Fuchs) to the Inscription from the Ištar Temple; and Chapter VIII to epigraphs on clay tablets. [75]   Chapter IX contained a catalogue of objects. Following in the footsteps of his much earlier Die Inschriften Asarhaddons, Königs von Assyrien (1956), Borger did not edit each inscription separately, but rather edited parallel passages of different inscriptions together. Moreover, unlike that earlier work, where the variants were listed in footnotes, the BIWA transliterations embedded every minor textual variant within the transliterations. [76]   This complicated, yet detailed editing style produced information-packed pages with unfriendly, densely-annotated conflated texts (sometimes comprising material from as many as eight or nine different inscriptions). Despite these editions being difficult to use, even for experienced Assyriologists, Borger's many contributions have greatly furthered our understanding of the most important inscriptions of Ashurbanipal. BIWA's transliterations are without question very accurate and contain very few (minor/typographical) errors. In some ways, Borger achieved the goal that he set for himself in 1989, but in other ways he did not; BIWA produced top quality editions of Ashurbanipal's annals, but failed to produce editions of the complete corpus of texts (something that has still yet to be achieved). Moreover, it has replaced Streck, Asb. as the primary scholarly resource for this corpus of texts.     Since 1996, there have been many publications concerning Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, but few have made improvements to Borger's editions, or, at the very least, forwarded alternate interpretations of the extant source material. For example, J. Novotny, in 2002, reclassified text no. 5 as Prism I, rather than as Prism TVar, since that inscription should be regarded as a unique text, and he, in 2008, untangled some of the problems surrounding the compositional history of text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G), suggesting that the former annalistic text was written in 647 (Ashurbanipal's 22nd regnal year) and that the latter two inscriptions were composed one year later, in 646 (his 23rd year on the throne). [77]      In 2014, Novotny published a short monograph on a few texts of this Assyrian king. Selected Royal Inscriptions of Assurbanipal: L 3 , L 4 , LET, Prism I, Prism T, and Related Texts (State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Texts 10) was intended to be a teaching aid for students interested in temple building and decoration and in reading Assyrian texts other than the ones included in Borger, BAL 2 . Twenty texts, including text nos. 5 (Prism I) and 10 (Prism T) of this volume, were presented in typeset Neo-Assyrian cuneiform, together with transliterations, English translations, and complete glossaries of Akkadian words and personal names. [78]           Notes      47  For a good historical survey of previous work on the Ashurbanipal corpus (1866–1996), see Borger, BIWA pp. xii–xiii, xv–xvi, 1–3, 7–9, 86–87, 122–123, 126–128, 130–133, 173–175, 188, 258–259, and 297–299.      48  The following prisms were used with certainty by G. Smith: K 1678+ (text no. 11 [Prism A] ex. 2), K 1697+ (text no. 11 [Prism A] ex. 3), K 1700+ (text no. 4 [Prism D] ex. 3), K 1775+ (text no. 3 [Prism B] ex. 1), K 1794 (text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 1), K 1821 (text no. 1 [Prism E₁] ex. 1), and K 1828 (text no. 2 [Prism E₂] ex. 1*).       49  This publication format was used, for example, for G. Smith, Senn.       50  Annales pp. 250–295.      51  The royal inscriptions included in that work are: K 1794 (text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 1), K 2652 (a dedication inscription to Ištar), K 2674 (a tablet containing a collection of epigraphs), K 2675 (the Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription), K 2867 (the Large Hunting Inscription), Rm 3 (text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 2a), the Nabû Inscription, and the Mullissu Inscription. Col i of K 1794, which contains part of the prologue, was mistakenly regarded as the building report of col. x in part 2 of that book (pp. 18–25). Part 2 (pp. 89–99) also contained comments on Rm 1 by C. Bezold, C.F. Lehmann-Haupt, T.G. Pinches, and J.N. Strassmaier.       52  In that same volume, H. Winckler prepared an edition of a brick inscription of Aššur-etel-ilāni and a fragment of a cylinder inscription of Sîn-šarra-iškun.       53  Regarding H. Winckler's copy of Rm 1, see the comments of R. Borger in BIWA (p. 1).      54  The final process of preparing the book took several years, with the typesetting starting in the fall of 1908. Most of the first two volumes were completed by the fall of 1912 and the bulk of the third book was finished by the end of 1913. The final pieces were set in place in 1914 and 1915. For details, see Streck, Asb. pp. VII–VIII (with n. 1).      55  Streck, Asb. pp. CCXXX–CDLXXII.       56  The texts were edited primarily from published copies and photographs, rather than from the originals (in London and Berlin); see Streck, Asb. pp. V–VI. Moreover, many of the inscriptions in that volume were edited from a single source; for example, his no. 3.a.β (BE 8072) of section I.IV, a text now known today to have been written on twenty-seven bricks (Frame, RIMB 2 pp. 208–209 B.6.32.7). On one occasion, M. Streck edited an inscription in the wrong place: K 1703 (text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 3b) was regarded as a tablet, rather than as a prism. For editions of the dialogue between Ashurbanipal and Nabû and the colophons, see respectively Livingstone, SAA 3 pp. 33–35 no. 13 and Hunger, Kolophone.      57  The most important new Ashurbanipal texts for M. Streck were the three prism fragments published by V. Scheil (Prisme pp. 43–44 and pls. 6–7) since these pieces belonged to a new edition of this king's annals (which he designated as Prism F); these are text no. 9 (Prism F) exs. 36, 44, and 48. L.W. King's supplement to C. Bezold's four-volume Kouyunjik catalogue (King, Cat.) also contained a few new pieces.      58  Luckenbill, ARAB 2 pp. 290–407 §§762–1129. In addition, he also translated the few known inscriptions of Aššur-etel-ilāni and Sîn-šarra-iškun; see pp. 408–416 §§1130–1165 of that book.      5  On the quality of T. Bauer's copies, see the remarks of R. Borger in BIWA (p. xvi): “Es muss allerdings hervorgehoben werden, dass seine Kopien — trotz der schönen Handschrift — nicht immer voll zuverlässig sind. Die von ihm gebotenen Zeichenformen sind u.U. zu stark normalisiert nach bestimmten Drucktypen.”      60  Bauer, Asb. pls. 1–13. BM 105315+ (and duplicates) were designated as Prism A a  and this edition was regarded as a separate text from M. Streck's Prism F; the equation of Aa with F was first made by A.C. Piepkorn (see below). Until T. Bauer's 1933 copy, only a small portion of K 1794+ had been published; see 3 R pls. 27 and 34; G. Smith, Assurbanipal; and S.A. Smith in Keilschrifttexte 2. Earlier publications wrongly regarded the prologue, which reports of Ashurbanipal's building activities, as the main building report. This understanding was corrected when R. Campbell Thompson published an edition and copy of BM 121006+ (text no. 10 [Prism T] ex. 1) in 1931; see Thompson, Esar. pp. 29–36 and pls. 14–18.      61  For example, T. Bauer did not re-edit Prisms A, B, F (which he regarded as a different inscription than his A a ), G (K 1703), H, and Bauer's Prism G = A.C. Piepkorn's Prism K and R. Borger's Prism C. For details on Prism K = C, see the commentary of text no. 6 (Prism C) and Borger, BIWA p. 126.       6  Deposit 809 comprises A 7919–8162. The pieces were purchased by E. Chiera from a local dealer at Mosul and they were accessioned on December 10th, 1928. A.C. Piepkorn personally acquired fifteen additional pieces in Mosul in April, 1933. These remained in his possession until his death, at which time they were bequeathed to the Oriental Institute (Chicago); these are now A 11858–A 11870. A 11848–A 11858 were also purchased by Chiera. This material is generally thought to be the result of clandestine digging at Nineveh during R. Campbell Thompson's excavations; many are believed to have come from Area SH.      63  Piepkorn, Asb. p. 3.      64  A.C. Piepkorn's Prism K was represented by a single fragment (K 1703). This corresponded to T. Bauer's Prism G. The designation K was used to avoid confusion with the designations provided for the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal by A.T.E. Olmstead in his Historiography; see Piepkorn, Asb. p. 101 n. 1.       65  Piepkorn, Asb. pp. 3–4. Like D.D. Luckenbill, A.C. Piepkorn was highly influenced by A.T.E. Olmstead's Historiography and took to heart his complaints about the growing tendency to use only “the final Assyrian edition.”      66  Editions of A 8011–A 8163 were to have appeared in that volume. As M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (JCS 40 [1988] p. 85 n. 3) have stated, A.C. Piepkorn seems to have prepared a complete manuscript of the Ashurbanipal prisms. In 1957, when Tadmor visited Piepkorn, the manuscript that he had prepared in the 1930s could no longer be located.       67  The catalogue was the result of H. Tadmor's first-hand examination of the material in 1956–57 and 1971 and M. Cogan's work on the texts in 1978 and 1980.      68  See n. 62.      69  Gerardi, Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 49–77.      70  Two important contributions of E. Weissert on the life and inscriptions of Ashurbanipal are “Royal Hunt and Royal Triumph in a Prism Fragment of Ashurbanipal (82-5-22,2),” which was published in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 (pp. 339–358), and his treatment of this king's rise to power in PNA 1/1 (pp. 160–163 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I).       71  Frame, RIMB 2 pp. 194–247 B.6.32.1–2016. The inscriptions of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn and Aššur-etel-ilāni were also published in that volume; see pp. 248–259 B.6.33.1–2001 and pp. 261–268 B.6.35.1–5.      72  For details, see Borger, BIWA pp. vii–xviii.      73  These were published on thirteen microfiche, as 8 o -Heft, 4 o -Heft, and LoBl.      74  The contents of R. Borger's BIWA volume — minus, of course, the inscriptions on tablets — are found in RINAP 5/1.      75  Chapter I also contained transliterations of Prisms B, D, I, C, Kh, G, and T; and Chapter II also contained transliterations of Prisms I, C, Kh, G, and T. In addition, numerous annalistic texts written on clay tablets were included in BIWA Chapters I–IV; for example, the Letter to Aššur (K 2802+) is edited on pp. 76–82, the Nergal-Laṣ Inscription (K 2631+) on pp. 82–85, K 2652 (and duplicates) on pp. 101–103, and K 2656+ (and duplicates) on pp. 155–158.      76  For details, see Borger, BIWA pp. xiii–xiv and 2. For example: A II 107 F II 18 B III 1 C IV 11)  ina tukul  ||  tu-kul-ti  an-šár  u  || Ø  dingir XV(auch C = CND4) ||  dingir amar-utu(B = B1, B9, B/D17, B/D20, D10) dingir-meš || Ø(F, B ; C = CND4 hiat) Ø || gal-meš(A26) en-meš- ia  ||  iá  (C = CND4 hiat) ta* ||  ul-tu  ||  iš -[ tú ](A14) || Ø(F, B, C) šà || šà- bi  || Ø(F, B, C)  lú en || Ø(F, B, C) uru-meš || Ø(F, B, C).       77  Respectively Studies Walker p. 192 n. 6 and SAOC 62 pp. 127–135. R. Borger (BIWA pp. 131 and 257), for example, thought that text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G) were all written in the same year: 647. Further details about the dating of these inscriptions is provided in the Dating and Chronology section.      78  Most of the editions included in that volume were prepared by J. Novotny. The edition of the Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription (SAACT 10 no. 20), however, was prepared by S. Parpola and reviewed by Novotny only in the final proofs."

      "text": "Ashurbanipal was a son of Esarhaddon by one of the latter's wives, very likely Ešarra-ḫammat. [79]   His paternal grandfather and grandmother were Sennacherib and Naqīʾa (Zakūtu). Esarhaddon had many sons and daughters and Ashurbanipal may have been his fourth eldest son. Sîn-nādin-apli, Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, and Šamaš-mētu-uballiṭ were his older brothers, Šērūʾa-ēṭirat his older sister, and Aššur-taqīša-libluṭ, Aššur-mukīn-palēʾa, and Aššur-etel-šamê-erṣeti-muballissu were the eldest of his younger brothers. [80]   As a younger son of the king, Ashurbanipal appears not to have been destined to be the next king of Assyria, an honor that had been originally planned for Sîn-nādin-apli, and, thus, the young prince was trained in the scribal arts. [81]   One of his early inscriptions (the so-called School Days Inscription) describes this part of his education:     [The gods Šamaš (and) Adad] placed at my disposal the lore of the diviner, a craft that cannot be changed; [the god Mardu]k, the sage of the gods, granted me a broad mind (and) extensive knowledge as a gift; the god Nabû, the scribe of everything, bestowed on me the precepts of his craft as a present; the gods Ninurta (and) Nergal endowed my body with power, virility, (and) unrivalled strength. I learned [the c]raft of the sage Adapa, the secret (and) hidden lore of all of the scribal arts. I am able to recognize celestial and terrestrial [om]ens (and) can discuss (them) in an assembly of scholars. I am capable of arguing with expert diviners about (the series) “If the liver is a mirror image of the heavens.” I can resolve complex (mathematical) divisions (and) multiplications that do not have a(n easy) solution. I have read cunningly written text(s) in obscure Sumerian (and) Akkadian that are difficult to interpret. I have carefully examined inscriptions on stone from before the Deluge that are sealed, stopped up, (and) confused. [82]    By late 673/early 672, the situation had changed: Sîn-nādin-apli, Esarhaddon's eldest son who is presumed to have been heir designate since 677, had died or fallen out of favor [83]   and the king was very concerned about who would follow him on the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia. Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, now the eldest living son, was chosen to be the next king of Babylon, and Ashurbanipal, then the third eldest son, was nominated to be the next ruler of Assyria; Šamaš-mētu-uballiṭ, for whatever reason, was overlooked. [84]   Given the circumstances of his own accession to the throne, [85]   Esarhaddon, with the assistance of his mother Naqīʾa, went to great lengths to ensure a smooth transition. In Ayyāru (II) 672, the king assembled people from every part of the empire and had them swear by the gods to respect the succession and protect his sons, before and after sitting on their respective thrones. It took days to complete all the oath swearing ceremonies and an army of scribes to prepare tablet copies of the treaty that were to accompany their oath takers home. [86]   Ashurbanipal, and probably also Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, took up residence in the House of Succession at Nineveh and began their training. In his School Days Inscription, Ashurbanipal states the following about this period of time:    With (carefully) selected companion(s), this is how I spent all of my days: I cantered on thoroughbreds, rode stallions that were raring to go; I [h]eld a bow (and) made arrows fly as befits a warrior; I threw quivering lances as if they were javelins; I took the reins (of a chariot) like a charioteer (and) made the rims of the wheels spin; I ... arītu-shields (and) kabābu-shields like a military specialist. I am proficient in the best technical lore of all specialists, every one of them. At the same time, I was learning proper lordly behavior, becoming familiar with the ways of kingship. I stood before the king who had engendered me, regularly giving orders to officials. N[o] governor was appointed without me, no prefect installed without my consent. [87]      Despite Esarhaddon's best efforts, not everyone was happy with the succession arrangement. In late 671 and early 670, high-ranking officials plotted to kill the king and his family. [88]   The conspiracy was discovered and the instigators and their supporters were publicly executed. [89]   In the days following the failed rebellion, the Assyrian king promoted more vigorously than before the roles of the future kings of Assyria and Babylon, especially in the western part of the empire, where images of the heir designates appeared together with representations of Esarhaddon. [90]       On his way to Egypt in 669, Esarhaddon fell ill and died on the tenth day of Araḫsamna (VII). [91]   Naqīʾa carried out her son's wishes and saw that her grandson Ashurbanipal became king of Assyria. In Kislīmu (IX), presumably after Esarhaddon's funeral, the queen-mother gathered together the royal family and court and made them swear once again their allegiance to Ashurbanipal, at the time of his coronation. [92]   Shortly after becoming king, at the beginning of his first official year as king, Ashurbanipal fulfilled some of his father's wishes: he installed his younger brothers Aššur-mukīn-palēʾa and Aššur-etel-šamê-erṣeti-muballissu as šešgallu-priests in Aššur and Ḫarrān, placed Šamaš-šuma-ukīn on the throne of Babylon, and returned Marduk and his entourage to their rightful place in Esagil (“House whose Top is High). [93]   Ashurbanipal's reign got off to a good start.       Notes      79  Despite the lack of direct evidence, most scholars generally believe that Ashurbanipal's mother was Ešarra-ḫammat, the only queen of Esarhaddon for whom we have a name. She is also usually regarded as the mother of Ashurbanipal's older brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn. For further details and discussions of the evidence, see in particular Weissert, PNA 1/1 pp. 160–161 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I.1.b; and Novotny and Singletary, Studies Parpola pp. 174–176.      80  For further information on Ashurbanipal's large family, see Parpola, LAS 2 pp. 117–118; Weissert, PNA 1/1 pp. 160–163 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I.1; and Novotny and Singletary, Studies Parpola pp. 167–177.      81  Some of his education took place under the tutelage of astrologer and scholar Balāssî, as suggested by a letter; see Parpola, SAA 10 p. 30 no. 39.      82  K 2694 + K 3030 i 14–23 (L 4 ; Novotny, SAACT 10 p. 77 no. 18).      83  The fate of this prince, who is mentioned by name in only one text (Starr, SAA 4 pp. 160–161 no. 149), is not known. Following more recent scholarship, it is assumed here that Sîn-nādin-apli and Ashurbanipal are two separate individuals; it seems unlikely that Sîn-nādin-apli was the birth name of Ashurbanipal. For details, see Weissert, PNA 1/1 p. 161 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I.1.f–g.1'; and Weissert, PNA 3/1 pp. 1138–1139 sub Sīn-nādin-apli.      84  E. Weissert (PNA 1/1 p. 162 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli I.1.h) has suggested that Esarhaddon bypassed his third eldest son because of his sickly nature, a fact that one might deduce from his name: “The god Šamaš has revived the dead.”       85  See, for example, Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 119–121; Leichty, RINAP 4 p. 2; and Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/2 pp. 28–29.       86  Because Esarhaddon's Succession Treaty (Parpola and Watanabe, SAA 2 pp. 28–58 no. 6) has received a great deal of attention, especially after the discovery of a new copy of it at Tell Tayinat in 2009, it will only be discussed briefly here. According to text no. 11 (Prism A) and some later copies of text no. 9 (Prism F), some of the oaths were sworn on 12-II-672; see the on-page note to text no. 9 (Prism F) i 10 for further details. According to early copies of text no. 9 (Prism F) and copies of the treaty itself, other oaths were sworn on 16-II and 18-II-672. It is certain from this evidence that the oath-swearing ceremonies took at least seven days to complete. The number of copies written out on this occasion is still a matter of speculation, but it has recently been tentatively suggested that there may have been as many as 200 copies (Fales, RA 106 [2012] p. 148). Whatever the original number may have been, only parts of ten of those tablets survive today. Eight were found in the throne room of Ezida (the Nabû temple at Kalḫu), one (comprising three fragments) was discovered at Aššur (provenance not recorded), and one was found in a temple at Tell Tayinat. For further details, see in particular Harrison and Osborne, JCS 64 (2012) pp. 125–143; Lauinger, JCS 64 (2012) pp. 87–123; Fales, RA 106 (2012) pp. 133–158; and Taylor, “The Succession Treaties of Esarhaddon,” Nimrud: Materialities of Assyrian Knowledge Production ( http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/nimrud/livesofobjects/ successiontreaties/  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/nimrud/livesofobjects/ successiontreaties/] ).       87  K 2694 + K 3030 i 24–33 (L 4 ; Novotny, SAACT 10 p. 77 no. 18). Numerous extant Neo-Assyrian letters to and from the heir designate of Assyria support the fact that Ashurbanipal was active in the royal court after his promotion to the rank of crown prince.      88  For the details, see Nissinen, SAAS 7 pp. 108–153.      89  According to two Babylonian chronicles (Grayson, Chronicles p. 86 no. 1 iv 29 and p. 127 no. 14 line 27'), “In Assyria the king put his numerous officers to the sword.”      90  The most famous of these are known from the steles discovered at Zinçirli (ancient Samʾal) and Tell Aḥmar (ancient Til Barsip); see Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 179–186 nos. 97–98 (with references to previous literature), especially p. 183 fig. 5. A letter from the chief scribe Ištar-šumu-ēreš to Esarhaddon (Parpola, SAA 10 pp. 12–13 no. 13) records that images of Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn were also placed at Ḫarrān.      91  Grayson, Chronicles p. 86 no. 1 iv 30–31 and p. 127 no. 14 lines 28'–30'.      92  Parpola and Watanabe, SAA 2 pp. 62–64 no. 8. Ashurbanipal's older brothers Šamaš-šuma-ukīn and Šamaš-mētu-uballiṭ are singled out in the Zakūtu Treaty. A.T.E. Olmstead (History of Assyria p. 408) suggests that the latter did not accept the new treaty and paid for it with his life. There is nothing in the textual record to suggest that Šamaš-mētu-uballiṭ sought ill will against his younger brother and was executed as a result. What happened to this prince after he swore an oath to protect Ashurbanipal in IX-669 is completely unknown. His “disappearance” from Neo-Assyrian sources is not surprising, especially since he is mentioned by name in only two texts. This is less shocking when one takes into account the fact that Naqīʾa disappears from the textual record immediately after Ashurbanipal's coronation. For a hymn celebrating this king's coronation, see Livingstone, SAA 3 pp. 26–27 no. 11.      93  K 891 obv. 10–13 (L 3 ; Novotny, SAACT 10 p. 80 no. 19) and 2694 + K 3030 ii 26'–iii 29' (L 4 ; Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 78–79 no. 18)."

      "text": "Although many of the events of Ashurbanipal's reign are well documented in his  res gestae , the internal chronology of his long reign is not as certain as one would like. This vexing problem has long been known. [94]   In 1970, Grayson succinctly described the issues at hand:     The chronology of the reign of Ashurbanipal is still one of the more uncertain areas in Neo-Assyrian history and yet one of the most crucial. ... The reason that this is such a problematic area is the fact that chronologically oriented sources for Ashurbanipal are singularly sparse. There is no eponym chronicle for the entire reign; the eponym list breaks off at 649; no Babylonian chronicles are preserved beyond 667; and the chronological confusion is compounded by Ashurbanipal's “annals.” In the text of the annals no eponyms are quoted for events but rather the campaigns are numbered in order of their appearance in the narrative and since the order of appearance is often different in the various editions, the number of the same campaign is often different. The designation “campaign” is also misleading for several expeditions or military incidents are commonly included under what is introduced as one campaign. The sequence of events in the narrative is unreliable for campaigns are arranged primarily along geographical rather than chronological lines. In other words Ashurbanipal's “annals” are not true Assyrian annals at all; rather they are a cross between the annals and display texts. Given these difficulties, how is one to reconstruct a chronology? [95]      Nearly forty years later, the situation has barely changed. Despite having a wealth of sources for Ashurbanipal's reign, there are many gaps in our knowledge. The sketch of the military and political events given here is based to a large extent on Grayson, ZA 70 (1980) pp. 227–245; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 143–155; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 164–168 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3–6.    In Appendix C of his chronological study, Grayson listed a total of thirty-one “incidents” that are recorded in the extant corpus of Ashurbanipal's annalistic texts; [96]   these took place between his accession year (668) and his 30th regnal year (639). Before diving into the survey of military expeditions and political events, it might be useful to present some of the information in a couple of tables, showing which “incidents” each inscription included. Table 1 arranges the information “geographically” (following the arrangement of the “campaigns” in the inscriptions) and Table 2 presents the material chronologically (generally following Grayson's proposed chronology).

      "text": "Egypt and the West    Generally speaking, Ashurbanipal had few problems in the Levant and he benefitted from Assyria's strong position in the region. The bond between Assyria and the west appears to have been strengthened during the reigns of his grandfather and father; for example, Esarhaddon claims that twenty-two kings supplied him with building materials while constructing the armory at Nineveh. [99]    During the transition of power in 669, at least as far as the textual record is preserved, Levantine and Cypriot rulers maintained good relations with Assyria. The agreements that they had with Esarhaddon were honored after Ashurbanipal ascended the throne. The new king of Arwad, Yakīn-Lû, like his predecessor Mattan-Baʾal, swore loyalty to Assyria. [100]    If Assyrian inscriptions are to be believed, Arwad may have sent troops and boats with the Assyrian army on its campaign to Egypt in 667. [102]    After Yakīn-Lû died, Ashurbanipal arbitrated the succession and backed Azi-Baʾal as the next ruler.     In 669, tensions in Egypt had flared up. Esarhaddon was en route to invade the country for a third time when he fell ill and died. Because Ashurbanipal was involved in matters closer to home, Taharqa and his supporters took the opportunity to consolidate their autonomy over Egypt. [103]    The Kushite pharaoh marched to Memphis, entered the city, and began ridding Egypt of Assyria and its influence, starting with the garrisons stationed there by Esarhaddon. Upon hearing the news, [104]    Ashurbanipal dispatched a large army to Egypt. Along the way, numerous western vassals paid tribute and sent troops and equipment (including boats) to aid in the fight. Assyrian and Egyptian forces clashed at the city Kār-Bānītu. Assyria won the day and, when news of this reached Memphis, Taharqa and his supporters fled to Thebes and then further south, beyond the reach of Ashurbanipal's army. [105]    The Assyrians once again occupied Memphis and dealt appropriately with anti-Assyrian conspirators. [106]    Afterwards, some of the local rulers who had supported or conspired with Taharqa, Necho and Šarru-lū-dāri in particular, were taken to Assyria. [107]    In the Assyrian capital, Ashurbanipal made Necho swear a new oath of fealty before he was permitted to return to his post.      When the exiled Taharqa died, his nephew Tanutamon, the son of Shabako, proclaimed himself pharaoh, secured Thebes and Heliopolis, and marched to Memphis. [108]    When news of the attack reached Nineveh, Ashurbanipal dispatched his army to Memphis. As soon as the Assyrians set foot on Egyptian soil, Tanutamon is reported to have fled south, first to Thebes, then to Kipkipi. The former city, a bustling metropolis and major religious center, was captured and plundered; in addition to an abundance of gold and silver, two metal obelisks were sent to Nineveh as part of the vast spoils of war. Psammetichus I (Nabû-šēzibanni) was installed as ruler in Sais and Memphis; Tanutamon, however, remained the ruler of Kush and ruled from the south. After the sack of Thebes, Assyrian sources are silent on events in Egypt, apart from the fact that at some point Psammetichus had severed ties with Assyria and that the Lydian king Gyges (see below) had sent him troops. [109]       Tyre proved itself to be a pocket of anti-Assyrian resistance, as it had been in the time of Esarhaddon. During his first decade as king, Ashurbanipal set up outposts at every major access point to the city, including those by sea, thus depriving the important coastal city of food and fresh water. [110]    Baʾalu, Tyre's ruler, eventually submitted. To ensure his loyalty, one of Baʾalu's daughters and several of his nieces were taken to Nineveh. In addition, Baʾalu voluntarily sent his son Yāḫi-Milki to the Assyrian capital. As a sign of good faith, Ashurbanipal dismantled the outposts and reopened the trade routes. The powerful island kingdom did not remain loyal for the duration of Ashurbanipal's reign. Sometime during his third decade on the throne, the Assyrian army was forced to return to the region. Ušû, the mainland portion of Tyre, was attacked and looted since the people of the city are said to have withheld payment. [111]    Interestingly, the reigning king of Tyre is not mentioned so it is unclear what role he may have played in this incident.      Anatolia    Near the start of Ashurbanipal's reign, a mounted messenger from the remote kingdom of Lydia arrived in Nineveh. This caused a bit of a stir in the Assyrian court because no one could understand a word he was saying. After an interpreter was finally found, Ashurbanipal and his advisors could relax as the envoy bore good tidings and a request for aid: Gyges, a ruler of western Anatolia, needed Assyria's help defeating Cimmerian tribes. [112]    Apparently, the Lydian ruler was told by the god Aššur in a dream that he would be victorious in battle and that vision inspired him to seek help from Ashurbanipal. The Assyrian king claims that Gyges successfully kept the Cimmerian threat at bay and that as a sign of their friendship he sent two captive tribal leaders to Nineveh. [113]    Cordial relations between the countries lasted for some time. Then around 645, Lydia was overrun by the Cimmerians and Gyges was killed. [114]    Because Gyges had sent aid to Egypt, which had cut ties with Assyria, Ashurbanipal presumably did not help his onetime ally. Gyges' son (Ardys) saw the writing on the wall and resumed good relations with Ashurbanipal, who took the opportunity to use the renewed alliance to hamper future Cimmerian intrusions into Assyria.    Following Ashurbanipal's successes in Egypt (the sack of Thebes) and at Tyre, several major Anatolian rulers sent offers of friendship to Assyria: Sanda-šarme of Ḫilakku (Cilicia) and Mugallu of Tabal (and probably also Melid) sent substantial audience gifts, as well as their daughters, to Nineveh. [115]    In response, the Assyrian king imposed an annual payment of horses on the latter. [116]    Mugallu, a man who had caused problems for Esarhaddon, appears to have remained loyal to the end of his life. His son (who may have been called Mussi), however, abandoned Assyria and allied himself with the Cimmerian chieftain Tugdammî (Lygdamis of Classical sources). [117]    Tugdammî attempted to invade Assyria twice, but calamity befell him on both occasions. On the first occasion, his camp was engulfed in fire and, on the second, he died (from a remote magical attack carried out by Ashurbanial's inner circle); his son Sandakšatru succeeded him. Because no inscriptions are preserved for the last years of Ashurbanipal's reign, no further information is available on Ashurbanipal's dealings with Tabal and the Cimmerians.     The North and Northeast    For most of his reign, Ashurbanipal appears to have had relatively little trouble north and northeast of Assyria. Nevertheless, the Assyrian army is known to have marched to the region at least three times, all perhaps between his 9th (660) and 12th (667) regnal years.    Before Ashurbanipal became king, thekingdom of Mannea had made serious inroads into territory held by the Assyrians; many cities and towns were appropriated during that time, perhaps with aid from Cimmerian tribes. Towards the end of his first decade as king, Ashurbanipal decided to reverse Assyria's fortunes on its northeastern frontier. The Assyrian army, under the guidance of the king's generals, was sent out to deal with matters. [118]    While encamped at Dūr-Aššur, the Mannean king Aḫšēri made a daring nighttime attack on Ashurbanipal's forces. The surprise did not go as planned: the Assyrians were victorious and pursued Aḫšēri and his supporters deep into the heart of Mannea. The Mannean king fled to the remote city Atrāna (or Ištatti according to one text). From that stronghold, he heard about the capture of his cities and fortresses, as well as the deaths of his loyal supporters. The Manneans were not pleased with the havoc the Assyrian had wreaked on their country and they rebelled: Aḫšēri was killed and his body dragged through the streets. A man by the name of Uallî took control. To make amends for the actions of his predecessor, he sent a large payment to Ashurbanipal, together with his son Erisinni and one of his daughters to ensure peace between the two kingdoms. The Assyrian king accepted the gifts, but demanded an additional tribute of thirty horses. The new Mannean ruler, as far as the textual record is preserved, appears to have agreed to Ashurbanipal's terms; Uallî seems to have remained loyal to Assyrian interests.    Some of the Median rulers who had once sworn fealty cast off the yoke of Assyrian domination and became aggressive; these actions may (or may not) have been inspired by their northern neighbor Mannea (when Aḫšēri was king). Assyrian troops captured the Median city-lords Birisḫatri, Sarati, and Pariḫi and carried them off to Nineveh. [119]    Numerous settlements under their authority are reported to have been plundered. According to Ashurbanipal, it took a single campaign to reaffirm Assyrian dominance in the region.    The once-powerful kingdom of Urarṭu, for the most part, was on friendly terms with Ashurbanipal and two of its kings, Rusâ (III?) and Sarduri (III?), sent envoys, messages of goodwill, and gifts. [120]    Apart from one incident with one of its governors, Assyria and Urarṭu had no problems with each other. Andaria, a man who is referred to as a governor or field-marshal, launched an attack on the Assyrian provinces of Uppumu and Kullimmeri, both of which had been established after Esarhaddon defeated Ik-Teššup of Šubria in 673; it is unknown whether this man acted on his own initiative or on the orders of the Urarṭian king. In a night battle, Assyrian troops reportedly defeated this Urarṭian and beheaded him. No further military actions are recorded against Assyria's northern neighbor.

Grayson's Arwad 1 is not included in text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂). It is not known exactly when Yakīn-Lû replaced Mattan-Baʾal (a vassal of Esarhaddon). Because Ashurbanipal reports that Yakīn-Lû had submitted to Assyria for the first time during his reign, it is possible that Yakīn-Lû became king of Arwad sometime in 669 or 668.        101  Numerous inscriptions record that Levantine and Cypriot rulers helped the Assyrian army. Text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 7 (Prism Kh) record the names of the twenty-two kings who provided troops and boats; Iakīn-Lû of Arwad is among them. The reliability of the list has been called into question as it copies the list of rulers in Esarhaddon's inscriptions (see n. 99), but with a few minor alterations. If there is some truth to Ashurbanipal's claim, then Yakīn-Lû may have become an Assyrian vassal in 667, as A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] p. 230) has suggested.       102  Radner, PNA 1/1 p. 239 sub Azi-Baʾal 1.

A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230–231 and 233) very tentatively proposes ca. 662 as the date of his Arwad 2. Given the lack of evidence, a precise date cannot be suggested. It is certain, however, that Yakīn-Lû died before the composition of text no. 3 (Prism B); the earliest known copy of that inscription is dated to 649.       103  Baker, PNA 3/2 pp. 1317–1318 sub Tarqû; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 143–144; Lämmerhirt, RLA 13/5–6 (2012) p. 466 sub Tarqû; Onasch, ÄAT 27/1 pp. 147–154; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 164 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.a.1'. Text no. 2 (Prism E₂) iii 6–iv 1', text no. 3 (Prism B) i 48–i 90, text no. 4 (Prism D) i 38–75, text no. 6 (Prism C) ii 4'–2'', text no. 7 (Prism Kh) ii 1'–19'', text no. 8 (Prism G) ii 1'–32', and text no. 11 (Prism A) i 52–117. Text no. 9 (Prism F) and text no. 12 (Prism H) do not include Egypt 1. The date of the campaign is certainly 667: the event is recorded in a Babylonian chronicle for Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's 1st regnal year (= Ashurbanipal's 2nd year).       104  It is possible that some of the anti-Assyrian activities of Taharqa and his allies described by Ashurbanipal may have taken place in 669 and, thus, may have been the reason why Esarhaddon launched a third campaign against Egypt. Because Ashurbanipal was otherwise engaged with affairs in Babylon (the installation of his brother and the return of the statue of Marduk) and in the region of Dēr, he might not have been in a position to organize a large-scale military expedition to Egypt until late 668/early 667. Thus, Ashurbanipal's statement about immediately sending troops against Taharqa after news had reached him that Assyria had lost control of Memphis might be a deliberate untruth.       105  Early inscriptions of Ashurbanipal report that the Assyrian army marched to Thebes, which Taharqa abandoned when the Assyrian army arrived on the scene. The narrative stops abruptly and continues with a report about the treachery of several vassal rulers who were still secretly supporting Taharqa, despite the fact that they had just sworn loyalty to Ashurbanipal. Thus, it has been suggested that the Assyrians opted to deal with the oath-breakers rather than pursue Taharqa and this is the reason the Assyrians abandoned the expedition to Thebes; see Spalinger, JAOS 94 (1974) pp. 316–328. The sequence of events, as well as their timing, is problematic and requires sources other than the Assyrian annals to clarify it further.       106  The inhabitants of the cities Sais, Mendes, and Tanis (or Pelusium) are said to have been executed.        107  Baker, PNA 3/2 pp. 1248–1249 sub Šarru-lū-dāri 13; and Streck, PNA 2/2 p. 963 sub Nikkû.       108  Frahm, PNA 2/2 p. 881 sub Nabû-šēzibanni 12; Görg, RLA 13/5–6 (2012) p. 441 sub Tandamane; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 144; Kitchen, Third Intermediate Period4; Mattila, PNA 3/1 p. 997 sub Pišamelki; Mattila and Pruzsinszky, PNA 3/2 pp. 1310–1311 sub Tanut-Amani; Onasch, ÄAT 27/1 pp. 38–58, 89–90, and 154–168; Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 164 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.a.1'; and Spalinger, Lexikon der Ägyptologie 4 pp. 1164–1170 sub Psammetichus I.

This campaign is also mentioned by Herodotus (Hist. II 152). The fall of Thebes is now generally thought to have been ca. 664.       109  Text no. 11 (Prism A) ii 112a–115a.       110  Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 144–145; Lipiński, PNA 1/2 pp. 242–243 sub Ba'alu 2; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 164 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.a.3'. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230–231 and 233) tentatively proposes ca. 662 as the date of the Tyre incident. Since this incident does not appear in the Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription — a text that records the second Egyptian campaign and the submission of Mugallu, the king of Tabal — the submission of Baʾalu of Tyre presumably happened sometime after the events reported in that inscription. A precise date cannot be given at this time.        111  Text no. 11 (Prism A) ix 115–121. This incident is embedded in the narrative of Grayson's Arabs 2. The coastal city of Acco was attacked at the same time.         112  Aro-Valjus, PNA 1/2 pp. 427–428 sub Gūgu 1; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 146; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 164–165 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.b.1'. Text no. 1 (Prism E₁) vi 11–31', text no. 2 (Prism E₂) vi 14–vii 3', text no. 3 (Prism B) ii 86b–iii 4, text no. 4 (Prism D) ii 61'–72', text no. 6 (Prism C) iv 1'–7', text no. 7 (Prism Kh) iii 17''–30'', text no. 9 (Prism F) ii 10–ii 20, and text no. 11 (Prism A) ii 95–125. Gūgu (or Guggu) of Luddu is known as Gyges (Γυγης) in classical sources, which record his ascent to the throne, some of his achievements, and his death. Herodotus ( Hist.  I 8–14) states that he became king by murdering his predecessor Candaules and marrying his widow. The date of the first contact between Lydia and Assyria is not known and it is unclear if this happened before or after the first Egyptian campaign in 667. Since the event, Grayson's Lydia 1, appears in text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂), inscriptions thought to have been composed ca. 666–665 and 665–664 respectively, a tentative date, following A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230 and 232), ca. 666–665 is suggested here. An earlier date, ca. 668–667 is also possible.        113  As noted by S. Aro-Valjus (PNA 1/2 p. 428 sub Gūgu 1), “It remains unclear where this fight between the Lydians and the Cimmerians took place and whether Assurbanipal actually sent any help to Gyges.”       114  Classical sources state that it was the Cimmerian leader Lygdamis (Tugdammî) who killed Gyges. Ashurbanipal's inscriptions confirm that the Lydian ruler was killed by the Cimmerians, but claim direct responsibility: he prayed to Aššur and Ištar to have Gyges killed since he had allied himself with Egypt. The date of Gyges' death is uncertain, but it happened prior to the composition of text no. 11 (Prism A), the earliest possible date of which is 644. Thus, a general date of ca. 645–643 is assigned to Grayson's Lydia 2 incident. Further details about the date of text no. 11 (Prism A) will be addressed in the Chronology and Dating section below.        115  Fuchs, PNA 2/2 pp. 761–762 sub Mugallu; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 145; Pruzsinszky, PNA 3/1 p. 1088 sub Sanda-sarme; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 164–165 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.b.1'. Text no. 3 (Prism B) ii 63–74, text no. 4 (Prism D) ii 34'–48', text no. 6 (Prism C) iii 89'–105', text no. 7 (Prism Kh) iii 44'–6'', text no. 8 (Prism G) iii 15'–31', text no. 9 (Prism F) i 69–76, and text no. 11 (Prism A) ii 68–80. The statement about Mugallu not having previously submitted to Assyria in the time of Ashurbanipal's ancestors is supported by astrological reports, Babylonian chronicles, prophecies, queries to the sun-god, and royal correspondence; see Fuchs, op. cit. for details. Moreover, it is uncertain when and how he succeeded in taking the throne of Tabal from Iškallû. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 231 and 233) dates the Ḫilakku and Tabal incidents to ca. 662 since these events “would naturally occur after the successful campaigns against Egypt (‘Egypt 2') and Tyre.” The earliest extant inscription recording receipt of payment from Mugallu is the Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription (Novotny, SAACT 10 p. 84 no. 20 rev. 28–32). Note that that text does not mention that the ruler of Tabal sent his daughter to Nineveh; A. Fuchs (op. cit.) suggests that this fact was later inserted by mistake or that Mugallu's daughter arrived in the Assyrian capital after the composition of that inscription.       116  The payment of horses can be confirmed from an administrative document dated to 651 (Fales and Postgate, SAA 11 p. 69 no. 112). A letter of an inspector of the Nabû temple (Cole and Machinist, SAA 13 no. 98) mentions horses from Melid.       117  Fuchs, PNA 2/2 pp. 761–762 sub Mugallu; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 145–146; Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 164–165 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.b.1'; Pruzsinszky and Schmitt, PNA 3/1 p. 1087 sub Sandakšatru; and Schmitt and Van Buylaere, PNA 3/2 p. 1328 sub Tudgammî. Text no. 13 (Prism J) viii 6–11', text no. 21 line 19', and text no. 23 (IIT) lines 141b–159a; see also Borger, BIWA p. 202 K 120B+ lines 20–25. According to Strabo ( Geo.  I 61), it was the Cimmerian leader Lydgamis (Tugdammî) who killed Gyges of Lydia. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 232 and 235) dates the event to ca. 640 because Tugdammî is not mentioned in Prism A (text no. 11), but in Prism H (text no. 12). This may be true, but text no. 12 (Prism H) is not sufficiently preserved to be certain if the Tugdammî incident appeared in that inscription. It is possible that it was recorded for the first time in text no. 13 (Prism J). Therefore, it is possible that these events took place in Ashurbanipal's 30th regnal year (639) and thus a date ca. 640–639 is given here.   The reading of the name of Mugallu's son is uncertain. A. Fuchs (in Borger, BIWA p. 284) suggests that the partially preserved name may be an Akkadian rendering of the East Phrygian Μουσσιϛ; see Zgusta, Kleinasiatische Personennamen pp. 338–339 §988-7.       118  Baker and Schmitt, PNA 3/1 p. 1030 sub Raiadišadî; Baker and Schmitt, PNA 3/2 p. 1354 sub Uallî; Fuchs and Schmitt, PNA 1/1 p. 68 sub Aḫšēri; Fuchs and Schmitt, PNA 1/2 p. 403 sub Erisinni; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 146; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 165 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.c.1'.

Based on a query to the sun-god (Starr, SAA 4 p. 246 no. 269), Aḫšēri is presumed to have made an alliance with Cimmerian tribes; A. Fuchs (PNA 1/1 p. 68) suggests that this may have been the reason why this Mannean ruler was so successful and why he was able to keep Assyria out of his country for several years. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230 and 233) proposes a date of ca. 660 for the campaign. As correctly pointed out by Fuchs (PNA 1/1 p. 68), the Mannea incident could have taken place anytime between 663 and 649; the earliest firmly dated inscription recording the event is text no. 3 (Prism B).       119  Baker and Schmitt, PNA 3/1 p. 988 sub Pariḫi; Fuchs and Schmitt, PNA 1/2 p. 346 sub Biris(i)ḫatri; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 146–147; Kessler and Schmitt, PNA 3/1 p. 1092 sub Sarati; and Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 165 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.c.2'.

Text nos. 9 (Prism F), 11 (Prism A), and 12 (Prism H) do not include Grayson's Urarṭu 1; this may be the case also for text no. 13 (Prism J). Grayson's Urarṭu 2 is known only from text no. 11 (Prism A). The mention of the receipt of Rusâ's tribute is embedded in the narrative of the campaign against Gambulu and, thus, presumably took place in 653 or 652. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230–231 and 233–234) proposes dates of ca. 657 and ca. 643 for the Urarṭu 1 and 2 incidents, respectively. The capture of the Urarṭian governor Andaria could have occurred anytime between 663 and ca. 653; the earliest firmly dated inscription recording the event is text no. 6 (Prism C), which was likely composed in 647. As for Sarduri sending payment to Ashurbanipal, this clearly happened before the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni (644, 643, or 642), for which a firm date cannot yet be established, and, thus, a more general date of ca. 645–643 is tentatively suggested here."

      "text": "Elam, Gambulu, and Babylonia   As it had been for his grandfather Sennacherib, Elam proved to be the biggest thorn in Ashurbanipal's side.  [121]    A great deal of time and effort was spent dealing with the troubled and troublesome kingdom of Elam. When the Assyrian army was not campaigning in the region, Ashurbanipal was meddling in Elamite affairs of state. Despite his efforts, Elam and Assyria remained adversaries; even pro-Assyrian appointees to the Elamite throne did not remain in Ashurbanipal's good graces for long. Repeated transgressions against the oaths sworn by Assyria's gods soured friendly relations and ultimately brought an end to Elam as a political rival.    When Ashurbanipal ascended the throne, Assyria and Elam were on good terms; this was in part due to Esarhaddon having established a peace treaty with Urtaku several years earlier. Shortly after Ashurbanipal became king, a severe famine struck Elam. Assyria aided them by sending much needed grain and allowed starving Elamites to take refuge in Assyria. [122]   This, however, was not enough and Urtaku, apparently influenced by anti-Assyrian leaders and officials in Babylonia and Elam, took matters into his own hands, mustered his army, invaded Babylonia, and laid siege to Babylon. [123]    The unprovoked attack took the Assyrians by complete surprise. At first, Ashurbanipal was not concerned, since Elamite envoys were repeatedly assuring him of the enduring peace between their two countries, but, eventually, he sent his own men south to investigate. Upon receiving reliable information, Ashurbanipal mustered his army and dispatched them to Babylonia. Urtaku caught wind of this and fled to the Babylonian-Elamite border, but not before suffering a serious defeat. The Assyrian army did not continue its pursuit. Not long after arriving home, Urtaku died unexpectedly. [124]    Teumman, a man described by the Assyrian king as “the (very) image of a  gallû -demon,” seized power and sought to exterminate Urtaku's entire extended family. Urtaku's sons Ummanigaš, Ummanappa, and Tammarītu, together with their families and entourages, fled to Nineveh, where Ashurbanipal granted them asylum, much to the displeasure of the new Elamite king. [125]       Over the course of the next decade, relations between Assyria and Elam remained tense. Teumman (Tepti-Ḫumban-Inšušinak?) sent hostile messages to Assyria demanding the extradition of the fugitive members of the former Elamite royal family, while Ashurbanipal refused to comply; he even detained two of his messengers (Umbadarâ and Nabû-damiq). [126]    In 653 (Ashurbanipal's 16th regnal year), tensions came to a head and the Elamite king mustered his troops and marched towards Nineveh. Ashurbanipal was in Arbela, one of Ištar's principal cult centers, when he received word of the impending attack. The Assyrian army marched south to Dēr as quickly as it could. Teumman and his troops, who were preparing to invade Assyria via the east Tigris region at the stronghold Bīt-Imbî, [127]    heard about the approach of their foe and started heading back to Susa. The Assyrians pursued them and met them in open battle at Tīl-Tūba, which was situated on the Ulāya river. The battle was bloody and Teumman fought to the bitter end, when a common soldier unceremoniously cut off his head. [128]    The fugitive Elamite princes Ummanigaš and Tammarītu, who had accompanied the Assyrians, were installed as rulers: Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) was made king of Elam and his younger brother Tammarītu was installed as the ruler of the city Ḫidalu. [129]       On the march home, Ashurbanipal launched a full-scale assault on Gambulu. [130]   Its capital Ša-pī-Bēl, whose fortifications Esarhaddon had improved to defend against Elam, was taken, looted, and destroyed, and its leader Dunānu (the son of Bēl-iqīša), together with his family and supporters, were captured alive and taken to Nineveh. Ashurbanipal returned home, entered his capital via the Aššur Gate in the midst of a joyous celebration, showing off the vast spoils of war and humiliating his defeated foes. [131]   During triumphal processions held at Arbela, Aššur, and Nineveh, Dunānu and his brother Samgunu were paraded through the streets with the decapitated Elamite heads hung around their necks. [132]   When they returned to Nineveh, Ashurbanipal had the Gambulian leaders publicly executed. [133]   The head of Teumman, which had been preserved in salt, was hung at the Citadel Gate, to be a spectacle for all who entered that part of the capital. [134]       Although Ashurbanipal had kept Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) and his brother Tammarītu safe while Teumman was king and had appointed those sons of Urtaku to their positions of authority after the death of their adversary, good relations between Assyria and Elam did not last long. Shortly after becoming king, Ummanigaš allied himself with Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, who was thoroughly exasperated with his younger brother's constant meddling. After fifteen years of tolerating the king of Assyria's interference in internal religious and political affairs in Babylonia, the king of Babylon began secretly putting together a diverse and widespread anti-Assyrian coalition. Šamaš-šuma-ukīn incited the people of Akkad, Chaldea, Aram, and the Sealand to rebel against Assyrian control and won the support of the kings of Elam, Gutium, Amurru, Meluḫḫa (Ethiopia), and Arabia (through bribes and their distrust of Assyria). Ashurbanipal discovered his brother's intentions and made attempts to garner support in Babylonia, in Babylon in particular. [135]   By late 652, hostilities broke out and the sibling monarchs went to war. [136]       Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's rebellion lasted nearly four years (from 19-X-652 to after 30-V-648). [137]   Shortly after war was declared, the king of Babylon withdrew to his capital and prepared for the enemy. During the first part of the conflict (12-XII-652 to 11-IV-650), battles were fought all over Babylonia, from cities in the north to the Sealand in the south. Some victories went to the Assyrians, others to the Babylonians and their allies. [138]   Key cities occasionally changed hands. [139]   Given the number of armies on the move, it is no surprise that there was a considerable amount of chaos not only in Babylonia, but also in Assyria. To make matters worse, some major players secretly worked for the enemy, [140]    while others were unexpectedly removed from power by their own people and replaced. [141]    This made it very difficult to keep track of one's allies and enemies. Both kings did all    they could to discover the other's plans and movements. [142]        Despite military support from foreign rulers — the Elamite kings Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) and Tammarītu, and the Arabian tribal leader Abī-Iateʾ in particular — and crafty allies (especially the slippery governor of the Sealand Nabû-bēl-šumāti), the tide turned against Šamaš-šuma-ukīn early in the year 650. With the help of the loyal and capable Bēl-ibni, [143]    the military commander of the Sealand, Ashurbanipal took control of the south, gained significant ground in the north, and cut off major urban centers' access to food, water, and military aid. On the eleventh of Duʾūzu (IV), the Assyrians laid siege to Babylon; Borsippa, Cutha, and Sippar were also besieged. [144]    For two long years, the Babylonians endured the intense Assyrian blockade and suffered horribly from dehydration, malnutrition, and diseases. Documents from Babylon dated during the siege lend support to Ashurbanipal's grim descriptions in his inscriptions of the misery, despair, and death witnessed by the beleaguered citizens; to survive the ordeal, some people are said to have resorted to cannibalism. [145]       The siege, as well as the revolt, ended with the death of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn. Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal state that the gods threw the king of Babylon into a raging conflagration. It is uncertain from this cryptic remark whether Šamaš-šuma-ukīn took his own life or was murdered by his once-loyal supporters. [146]    Sometime after Abu (V) 648 (and probably before the end of that year), Babylon and Borsippa opened their gates to the Assyrians. [147]    The king of Babylon's principal supporters were severely punished, some on the spot and others later on, back in Nineveh. [148]    Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's prized possessions — including his crown, scepter, and seal — were taken to Nineveh as spoils of war. [149]    Once all of Babylonia was firmly in Assyrian control, new officials were appointed, including a new king of Babylon (Kandalānu). [150]   Since there is no record of anti-Assyrian activities in Babylonia between 647 and 627, Ashurbanipal must have selected loyal appointees.    With the rebellion successfully suppressed in Babylonia, the Assyrian king was again able to direct his attention elsewhere. Elam, under its new ruler Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), was Ashurbanipal's next target. In the month Simānu (III), the Assyrian army, accompanied by the deposed Elamite Tammarītu (who had taken refuge in Nineveh), marched south to Dēr, headed east into Elam, and attacked Bīt-Imbî, the fortress from which the Elamites launched many of their campaigns into Babylonia. [151]   After successfully capturing and plundering Bīt-Imbî, the Assyrians set foot in Elam proper and marched east. [152]   Ummanaldašu abandoned his capital Madaktu and fled to the mountains. A certain UmbaḪABua (Ḫumban-ḫabua) seized the throne, but fled shortly thereafter as the Assyrians continued to march east. Tammarītu was reinstalled as king in Susa, rather than at Madaktu or Ḫidālu. His second tenure as king, however, did not last long: he was removed for failing to keep his word to Ashurbanipal and taken to Nineveh to live out the rest of his days there. [153]   Ummanaldašu returned from hiding and reclaimed the Elamite throne.     In Šabāṭu (XI) of that same year, Ashurbanipal, at the request of Bēl-ibni, sent a letter to the elders of Elam, warning them that failure to hand over Nabû-bēl-šumāti, the high-profile fugitive governor of the Sealand who had wronged him, would result in him laying waste to Elam. [154]   The threat did not work. Nabû-bēl-šumāti remained at large and Ashurbanipal had no choice but to send his troops back to Elam. The Assyrians entered the country, retook the western part of Elam (the region around Bīt-Imbî, Rāši, and Ḫamānu), and then proceeded east. [155]   Ummanaldašu mustered his troops and set up camp on the banks of the Idide river. The Elamite fled back to the safety of the mountains when the Assyrians arrived. Ashurbanipal, frustrated and fed up, decided to crush Elam once and for all: not only does he claim to have destroyed that country's most important cities and fortresses, but he also asserts that he had strewn salt and cress on its arable land. The religious capital Susa bore the brunt of the Assyrian king's wrath: its palaces and temples were emptied of their possessions; statues of its gods, goddesses, and former rulers were taken away; the trees of its sacred groves were cut down; and the tombs of Elam's kings were unceremoniously opened and had their bones removed and carried off to Assyria. Countless members of the Elamite royal family and nobility were exiled to Nineveh. While Susa was being robbed of all its glory, the Assyrians made an amazing discovery: a statue of the Urukian goddess Nanāya was found. This image, which had apparently been there for 1,635 years (since the Old Akkadian period), was returned to its rightful place in Uruk on the way home. [156]       Ashurbanipal's campaigns severely destabilized Elam and greatly weakened Ummanaldašu's authority. When Ummanaldašu returned from hiding, his bid for the throne was challenged by Paʾê. [157]   The Assyrian king once again wrote to Ummanaldašu about extraditing Nabû-bēl-šumāti. The former governor of the Sealand found out and had his attendant kill him with his own sword. Ummanaldašu preserved Nabû-bēl-šumāti's corpse in salt and sent it, together with the head of his attendant, to Nineveh. [158]   This did not go over well with the Elamites and they rebelled. Ummanaldašu, as he had done several times before, hid in the mountains. [159]   A group of Assyrian soldiers tracked him down, captured him, and took him to Nineveh, where he lived out the rest of his days serving Ashurbanipal. [160]   Elam appears not to have been a problem for the Assyrians again.        The Arabs   Arab tribal groups were a mild nuisance to Ashurbanipal, just as they had been since the mid-eighth century. [161]    Prior to the outbreak of the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion (652–648), Ashurbanipal dealt with a few rulers who had not kept their oaths and who were disrupting Assyrian interests in the west. The Assyrian army marched against the Qedarite leaders Iautaʾ and Ammu-ladīn. The latter was captured with the assistance of the Moabite king Kamās-ḫaltâ. The former ruler, however, eluded capture after his tribesmen were defeated; [162]    his region, on the other hand, if Ashurbanipal's inscriptions are to be believed, was thoroughly plundered. Iautaʾ, the son and successor of Hazael, fled first to the ruler of the Nabayatean king Natnu and then, after being refused asylum by the Nabayateans, into the Arabian peninsula, where he hid for many years, before being taken captive to Nineveh. [163]        In place of Iautaʾ, Ashurbanipal made Abī-Yateʾ, son of Teʾri, ruler. [164]    Sometime after Ashurbanipal had declared war on Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, perhaps in 651 or at the very beginning of 650, the recently appointed Abī-Yateʾ, together with his brother Aya-ammu, broke the oaths they had sworn to Assyria, and formed an alliance with Babylon and sent fighting men to help Šamaš-šuma-ukīn. The Qedarite ruler and his supporters fought their way to Babylon and appear to have entered the city just before it closed its gates to the Assyrian army (IV-11-650). [165]    The fear of dying of starvation motivated Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's Arab allies enough to try to escape. While fleeing Babylon, Abī-Yateʾ and his supporters were captured and brought before Ashurbanipal. Despite the treachery of Abī-Yateʾ, the Assyrian king had compassion on the Qedarite ruler and reinstated him. Ashurbanipal would come to regret this decision a few years later. Sometime after the fall of Babylon, Abī-Yateʾ, his brother Aya-ammu, Natnu the Nabayatean, and Uaiteʾ (a son of Bir-Dāda) carried out raids on border towns and disrupted trade. A major campaign was undertaken by Ashurbanipal's generals. [166]    With much effort, the various Arab groups were defeated, and the instigators were brought to Nineveh to be severely punished for their crimes, oath breaking being the most grievous offense; Aya-ammu was flayed, while Uaiteʾ was publicly humiliated by making him guard the Citadel Gate like a dog and by hitching him up to the king's processional chariot and making him pull it like a horse during an akītu-festival. [167]    Due to the lack of sources, it is unclear if the war against Abī-Yateʾ, Natnu, and Uaiteʾ marked the end of Ashurbanipal's problems with the Arabs or if further military action was required to pacify them.     Other Political Events   At the start of Ashurbanipal's reign, in 668, the inhabitants of the east Tigris city Qirbit, under the leadership of Tandāya, regularly raided the area around the city Dēr. [168]    The harassed citizens of that city appealed to the newly enthroned Assyrian king for assistance. Several local governors were ordered to deal with the problem. Qirbit, together with other cities in the region, was captured, Tandāya was killed, and Akkudāya (one of the chief conspirators) was arrested and taken to Assyria. Sometime after the first campaign to Egypt (667), Ashurbanipal had the inhabitants of this troublesome region deported to Egypt; presumably, people from other parts of the empire were settled in Qirbit.    Several inscriptions written around his 30th regnal year (639–ca. 638) record that Ashurbanipal received messengers bearing messages of goodwill and audience gifts from distant foreign rulers. [169]    Cyrus I of Parsumaš (Persia), Pislumê of the remote land Ḫudimiri, Ḫundāru of the island kingdom Dilmun, Padê of the land Qadê, Šīlum of the land Ḫazmāni, and the ruler of the land Luppi are all said to have sent envoys and payment to Assyria; several reportedly did so after hearing about Ashurbanipal's victories in Elam.

Text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A) do not include Elam 1–2. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 230 and 232) dates Elam 1 to 667, while Ashurbanipal was preoccupied with matters in Egypt. G. Frame (Babylonia p. 119 with n. 93) has argued in favor of a date of 664 or shortly before Urtaku's invasion of Babylonia and that proposal is followed here. The latest possible date is 664 since a Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson, Chronicles p. 128 no. 15 lines 2–3) records that an Elamite prince fled to Assyria on the twelfth day of the month Tašrītu (VII) of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's 4th regnal year (= Ashurbanipal's 5th year); that prince, together with other members of the Elamite royal family, are reported in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions to have fled to Elam when Teumman seized power. It is now generally assumed that Urtaku died shortly after his failed invasion of Babylonia. Thus, Elam 1 took place ca. 664 and Elam 2 in 664 (around 12-VII-664).       123  These men were the Gambulian leader Bēl-iqīša, the  šandabakku  (governor) of Nippur Nabû-šuma-ēreš, and the Babylonian official Marduk-šuma-ibni. See Baker, PNA 1/2 pp. 315–316 sub Bēl-iqīša 7; Baker, PNA 2/2 pp. 731–732 sub Marduk-šuma-ibni 3; and Brinkman, PNA 2/2 p. 883 sub Nabû-šuma-ēreš 2.       124  Bēl-iqīša and Nabû-šuma-ēreš, according to Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, both died in the same year as Urtaku. The former is reported to have died after being bitten by a mouse, while the later died from dropsy.       125  Baker and Waters, PNA 3/2 p. 1306 sub Tammarītu 1; Baker and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1383–1384 sub Ummanigaš 3; and Waters, PNA 3/2 p. 1382 sub Ummanappa 2. They were accompanied by Kudurru and Parrû, sons of their uncle Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš II), and sixty other members of the royal family.       126  Baker, PNA 2/2 p. 821 sub Nabû-de'iq 5; Baker and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1323–1325 sub Teumman 1; Frame, Babylonia pp. 121–124; Gerardi, Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 135–136; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 148; Henkelman, RLA 13/ (2013) pp. 616–617 sub Te-Umman;  Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 165–166 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.d.2'; and Waters, PNA 3/2 p. 1378 sub Umbadarâ.

Text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A) combine the Elam 3, Gambulu, and Elam 4 incidents. See also Borger, BIWA pp. 299–307 and Livingstone, SAA 3 pp. 67–68 no. 31. The campaign can be dated with certainty thanks to the mention of an eclipse in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, which took place on July 13th 653 (=Duʾūzu); see Mayr in Piepkorn, Asb. pp. 105–109. F.R. Stephenson (in Reade and Walker, AfO 28 [1981–82] p. 122), however, believes that the eclipse occurred in August 663. For evidence refuting that proposal, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 122–123 n. 112. The 653 date is followed here for the Elam 3 incident.       127  A.K. Grayson (CAH 2  3/2 p. 148) suggests that Teumman's assault was prompted by Šamaš-šuma-ukīn and that the Elamite army set foot on Babylonian soil. G. Frame (Babylonia p. 122) points out that it is unclear if Teumman's army moved beyond the borders of Elam.       128  The battle is depicted in a series of reliefs (with accompanying epigraphs) on the walls of Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace at Nineveh. See Barnett et al, Sculptures from the Southwest Palace 1 pp. 94–100 and 2 pls. 286–320. For studies of the visual narrative, see Watanabe, Iraq 66 (2004) pp. 103–114.       129  Tammarītu appears to have been installed in place of a certain Ištar-nandi (Šutur-Naḫūndi), who was also beheaded by the Assyrians; see text no. 6 (Prism C) vii 49–50 and text no. 7 (Prism Kh) vi 7''–8'', as well as Borger, BIWA p. 306 B line 11'//C line 6'.

The Gambulu incident is combined with Elam 3–4 in text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A). See also Borger, BIWA pp. 299–307. The date of the campaign can be established as late 653 (after Ulūlu [VI]) since Gambulu was attacked on the return home after the defeat of Teumman.       131  For the king's entrance into Nineveh via the Lilbur-iššak-Aššur Gate (“May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Endure”), see Borger, BIWA p. 301 nos. 10–11. See also Fuchs, MSAW 5 pp. 97–98.       132  The head of Teumman was hung around Dunānu's neck, while that of Ištar-nandi (Šutur-Naḫūndi) was hung around Samgunu's. For further information on this three-city procession, see Weissert in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 pp. 347–350. A relief from Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace likely depicts Dunānu and Samgunu (Barnett et al, Sculptures from the Southwest Palace 2 pls. 286, 304–305, and 312). The sight of Teumman's head apparently upset the two Elamite envoys who had been detained at Nineveh: Umbadarâ is said to have tried to pull out his own beard and Nabû-damiq stabbed himself with his own dagger.       133  Dunānu's deputy Mannu-kī-aḫḫē and the overseer of Gambulu Nabû-uṣalli were executed earlier, in Arbela; they had their tongues ripped out and were then flayed. Nabû-naʾid and Bēl-ēṭir, sons of the former  šandabakku  (governor) of Nippur Nabû-šuma-ēreš, were forced to publicly grind up the bones of their father; this reportedly took place at the Citadel Gate of Nineveh.       134  For the famous garden scene of Ashurbanipal, with the head of Teumman hanging from a branch of a tree, see Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pl. LXIV.       135  For example, see Harper, ABL no. 301, a letter of Ashurbanipal addressed to the citizens of Babylon, in which the Assyrian king appeals to the people of that city not to join with his brother and in return they would continue to enjoy their special privileged status. The letter is dated to the twenty-third of the month Ayyāru (II), presumably in the year 652.

Text nos. 3 (Prism B), 4 (Prism D), and 9 (Prism F) do not contain the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion. Text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G) insert the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion within the narrative of Elam 4. In text no. 11 (Prism A) Elam 4 and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn are split over two military reports: campaign 5 (which also includes Elam 3 and Gambulu) and campaign 6. Details about the war are also known from numerous letters, queries to the sun-god, astronomical diaries, Babylonian chronicles, economic documents, and an Aramaic tale written in Demotic script.        137  According to a Babylonian chronicle (Grayson, Chronicles p. 131 no. 16 line 11) hostilities began on 19-X-652. Babylon fell sometime after 30-V-648; BM 40577 is the last economic document from Babylon dated by Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's regnal years. For a chronological outline of the revolt, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 188–190. Uruk was pro-Assyrian and it does not appear to have been held or captured by the Babylonians or their allies. Ur was also pro-Assyrian, although its governor may have offered some type of submission to Šamaš-šuma-ukīn out of desperation; there is no evidence, however, that this city was ever occupied by Babylonian forces or its allies during the rebellion.       138  For example, the Assyrians were victorious at Ḫirītu (27-XII-652) and Babylonian forces captured Cutha in 9-VI₂-651.       139  For example, Nippur, which joined Šamaš-šuma-ukīn at the outset of the rebellion but fell to the Assyrians at the end of 651, and Cutha, which the Assyrians held at the outbreak of the war but lost to the Babylonians in mid-651. At Mangisu, the Assyrians defeated the Elamite troops sent to Babylonia by Ummanigaš.       140  The most notable case being the Sealand governor Nabû-bēl-šumāti, a son of Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan). Despite reports that the governor of the Sealand had sided with the king of Babylon and was conscripting troops in Elam, Ashurbanipal had faith that Nabû-bēl-šumāti remained loyal and sent troops to support him on the southern front. By the time Ashurbanipal had learned the truth about this Chaldean leader's feigned loyalty, it was too late: the men he had sent him were taken captive during the night and imprisoned in Elam. The vilification of Nabû-bēl-šumāti in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions is a testament to the intense rage felt by the Assyrian king toward this man who deceitfully and cunningly betrayed him. For details about this important ally of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, see Baker, PNA 2/2 pp. 811–814 sub Nabû-bēl-šumāti 10; Brinkman, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 56–57; and Frame, Babylonia pp. 175–182.   The loyalty of Sîn-šarra-uṣur, the governor of Ur, appears to have been questioned and doubts about whether or not he would defect may have prompted Ashurbanipal to replace him with Sîn-tabni-uṣur. On these two men, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 162–167; Frame, NABU 2004 p. 71 no. 69; Novotny, PNA 3/1 pp. 1148–1150 sub Sīn-tabni-uṣur 2; and Radner, PNA 3/1 pp. 1145–1146 sub Sīn-šarru-uṣur 9.       141  The Elamite king Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II), whom Ashurbanipal had appointed king, was an important ally of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn at the outset of the rebellion, but he was replaced by a certain Tammarītu, who in turn was deposed by Indabibi, who was murdered by Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III). The instability in Elam undoubtedly played a role in hurting Babylonia's effectiveness to hold off the Assyrians. The dates and lengths of reigns of these rulers are uncertain. M. Waters (SAAS 12 pp. 56–67) assigns the following dates: 653–652? to Ummanigaš, 652?–649? to Tammarītu, and 649?–648? to Indabibi. From a query to Šamaš (Starr, SAA 4 p. 270 no. 289), it is certain that Tammarītu was king of Elam by XI-651 and, from one of Ashurbanipal's dateable inscriptions (text no. 3 [Prism B]), it is known that Indabibi deposed his predecessor sometime before V-649. Because Tammarītu sought asylum with Ashurbanipal and not Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, to whom he sent aid, this might suggest that Babylon was under siege at the time he was removed from the throne; thus, Indabibi may have seized power sometime after 11-IV-650 (but before V-649). As for when he became king, this could conceivably have happened as early as the beginning of 651 since the first recorded battle took place on 12-XII-652 and since his predecessor is reported to have sent troops to Babylonia; as G. Frame (Babylonia p. 292 n. 19) points out, the battle at Mangisu must have taken place prior to his death. Given the lack of clear evidence, it is not known if Indabibi was deposed by Ummanaldašu before or after the fall of Babylon; however, it is now generally thought that Indabibi's tenure as king ended in 648. For details on Elam's participation in the Babylonian revolt, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 182–186.        142  See the comments of G. Frame (Babylonia p. 145): “Ashurbanipal frequently turned to the gods for advice on what to do and on what the enemy was planning. Extispicies were performed to determine the truth of reports which had reached him and the potential for success of various planned military movements.” The texts of these extispicies are published in Starr, SAA 4.       143  Baker, PNA 1/2 pp. 306–310 sub Bēl-ibni 18; and de Vaan, Sprache des Bēl-ibni.       144  Note the comments of G. Frame (Babylonia p. 150): “The goal of the Assyrians was to force the city into surrendering by cutting off its access to supplies of food and military aid .... Probably the Assyrians did not set up a continuous encirclement about the city but rather established a number of camps in the area in order to keep a close eye on it.”       145  Accounts of Babylon's dire straits are known from text no. 6 (Prism C) ix 1'–20', text no. 7 (Prism Kh) viii 1'–54', text no. 8 (Prism G) viii 1'''–16''''a, and text no. 11 (Prism A) iv 41b–46. At least six economic documents from Babylon date to the siege; these were written between 13-VIII-650 and 29-II-648. For details on these texts, see Frame, Babylonia p. 150 n. 81 and p. 153, and JCS 51 (1999) pp. 101–106.        146  W. von Soden, (ZA 62 [1972] pp. 84–85) suggests that an official by the name of Nabû-qātē-ṣabat threw Šamaš-šuma-ukīn into the fire; for evidence against that proposal, see Frame, Babylonia p. 154 n. 101. Ctesias' account of the death of Ashurbanipal may have mistaken the death of the Assyrian king at Nineveh with that of the king of Babylon; that story states that the Assyrian king had himself burned alive in his palace. If that description of Ashurbanipal's death was based on the death of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, then the king of Babylon may have committed suicide. For this opinion, see Frahm, Studies H. and M. Tadmor p. 39* and MacGinnis, Sumer 45 (1987–88) pp. 40–43. Another possibility is that Ctesias confused Ashurbanipal (Sardanapallos) with Sîn-šarra-iškun (Sarakos), who according to Berossos burnt down his palace around him when the Babylonian king (Bupalassaros = Nabopolassar) besieged him. Because nothing about Ashurbanipal's death is recorded in cuneiform sources, it has been sometimes suggested that Ashurbanipal also died by fire; see Frame, Babylonia p. 155.       147  Babylonian chronicles do not record the date of the end of the siege. G. Frame (Babylonia pp. 155–156 nn. 106–107) suggests that Babylon was captured by 1-XI-648 since large numbers of literary tablets were taken from Babylonia to Assyria after that time; see Parpola, JNES 42 (1983) pp. 7 and 11.       148  The rebels taken back to Assyria may have been executed on the very spot where Sennacherib had been murdered. For details on the murder of Sennacherib and where it might have happened (with references to earlier literature), see Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/2 pp. 28–29.        149  A relief showing the aftermath of the siege adorned part of Room M (the so-called Throne Room) of Ashurbanipal's palace at Nineveh. See Novotny and Watanabe, Iraq 70 (2008) pp. 105–125.        150  Ahmed, Southern Mesopotamia pp. 104–120; Baker, PNA 2/1 p. 601 sub Kandalānu 11; Brinkman, Prelude pp. 105–106; Brinkman, RLA 5/5–6 (1980) pp. 368–369 sub Kandalānu; Brinkman, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 60–62; and Frame, Babylonia pp. 191–213 and 296–306 (for information regarding who this king of Babylon might have been). Some scholars (especially S. Zawadzki [Fall of Assyria pp. 57–62]) have suggested that Ashurbanipal and Kandalānu were one and the same person, but this seems unlikely, as already pointed out by J.A. Brinkman and G. Frame.       151  Baker and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1380–1382 sub Ummanaldašu 3; Frame, Babylonia pp. 186, 204–206, and 293–295; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 151–153; Gerardi, Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 181–194; Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 166 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.d.4'; Waters, SAAS 12 pp. 58–75 and 117–118; and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1378–1379 sub UmbaḪABua. Text no. 7 (Prism Kh) ix 10–63'', text no. 8 (Prism G) ix 29''–x 16', text no. 9 (Prism F) iii 33–iv 16, and text no. 11 (Prism A) iv 110–v 62. Although it is not known when Ummanaldašu came to the throne, it is generally thought that he gained power in 648. G. Frame points out that there is no clear evidence that Indabibi's deposition took place before or after the fall of Babylon. M. Waters suggests that this may have happened sometime after Babylon was captured, following Frame's conjecture that that city's fall might have played a part in that king's removal from the throne. One plausible scenario is that relations between Ashurbanipal and Indabibi quickly deteriorated when the latter refused to extradite the villainous Nabû-bēl-šumāti. The Assyrian king threatened war, something he was able to do since the Babylonian rebellion had been quelled, and the Elamites fearing Ashurbanipal's wrath deposed Indabibi, and installed Ummanaldašu. This bold move bought them some time. The date of the Elam 5 incident has been a matter of debate. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] p. 235), following H. Tadmor's proposed chronological arrangement of Ashurbanipal's annals, suggests a date of 648. P. Gerardi (Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 194 and 207–208) suggests that the wars against Ummanaldašu happened in 647. Frame (Babylonia pp. 293–295) suggests three possible dates (III-648, III-647, and III-646), but prefers the III-647 date. Waters (SAAS 12 pp. 68–70) prefers a date of 647, but does not rule out that the expedition was launched in 648. Because text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G) are now thought to have been composed in 646 (and not in 647), the Elam 5 incident probably took place in 647; thus, the dates of Elam 6–8 differ from Grayson's proposed chronology. For discussions on the matter, see in particular Gerardi, Assurbaipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 185–199; Frame, Babylonia pp. 293–295; and Waters, SAAS 12 pp. 68–70. The motive for the campaign is uncertain. Grayson (CAH 2  3/2 p. 152) and Frame (Babylonia p. 204) suggest the expedition was to win back the buffer states, to seek revenge for Elam's participation in the Babylonian rebellion, and to replace Ummanaldašu with Tammarītu.        152  The chief archer of Elam, Imbappa, and members of Teumman's family were among the people taken prisoner. According to text no. 11 (Prism A), the Bīt-Imbî conquered by Ashurbanipal was a different city than the one conquered by Sennacherib. Apparently, the Elamites constructed a new Bīt-Imbî opposite the one destroyed by Ashurbanipal's grandfather.       153  The duration of Tammarītu's second tenure is unknown, but as M. Waters suggests (SAAS 12 pp. 72–74), it may have lasted for several months rather than that king being removed from the throne immediately after his installation, as Ashurbanipal's inscriptions insinuate. It is unclear exactly who removed Tammarītu from power. Bēl-ibni may have been involved since he was probably in Elam at the time hunting down Nabû-bēl-šumāti, who was still being protected by the Elamites.       154  The letter is dated by the eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫḫē (probably 647), the same year that text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G) were inscribed on ten-sided prisms. For a proposed historical background of BM 132980, see Frame, Babylonia pp. 206–207.       155  Baker, PNA 2/2 pp. 811–814 sub Nabû-bēl-šumāti 10; Baker and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1380–1382 sub Ummanaldašu 3; Frame, Babylonia pp. 206–208 and 293–295; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 151–153; Gerardi, Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns pp. 195–207; Ruby, PNA 1/1 pp. 166–167 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.d.5'; Waters, SAAS 12 pp. 75–79 and 117–118; and Waters, PNA 3/2 pp. 1378–1379 sub UmbaḪABua. Text no. 9 (Prism F) iv 17–vi 21, text no. 10 (Prism T) iv 12–v 32, and text no. 11 (Prism A) v 63–vii 8. The Elam 6 incident is regarded here as having taken place in 646; A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 231 and 235) and P. Gerardi (Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns p. 208) suggest that it took place one year earlier (647). Most scholars believe that the campaigns against Ummanaldašu took place during two consecutive years; Gerardi, however, argues that both wars took place in the same year. Close studies of the available sources by G. Frame (op. cit.) and M. Waters (op. cit.) strongly argue against such a scenario.       156  According to text no. 11 (Prism A) vi 116–124, Nanāya was returned to her sanctuary Eḫiliana (“House, Luxuriance of Heaven”) in the Eanna (“House of Heaven”) complex at Uruk on the first of Kislīmu (IX).       157  Baker and Waters, PNA 3/1 p. 979 sub Pa'ê; and Waters, SAAS 12 pp. 77–80. Text no. 11 (Prism A) vii 9–81. The date of some of the events of the Elam 7 incident (ca. 645) can be confirmed from a Neo-Assyrian letter (see the following note).       158  Harper, ABL no. 879 is dated to the twenty-sixth day of Duʾūzu (IV) of the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu (probably 645) and, as G. Frame (Babylonia p. 207) has suggested, that letter was either to accompany the corpse or was to be sent shortly after the body had been dispatched. The Elamite king blames a tribal group called the Martenaya for protecting Nabû-bēl-šumāti in Elam and says that he will punish them for their actions. Ashurbanipal did not bury the body of Nabû-bēl-šumāti, but made it “more dead than before” by cutting off its head and hanging it around the neck of Nabû-qātī-ṣabat, the simmagir-official of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn.       159  Text no. 11 (Prism A) x 6–39. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 231 and 235) dates the Elam 8 incident to ca. 643. This may be true, but since it is uncertain when text no. 11 (Prism A) was written (644, 643, or 642), it is best to give a more general date of ca. 645–643. Ummanaldašu may have been deposed as early as late 645, as M. Waters (SAAS 12 p. 109) suggests, but he may have been captured one or two years later. A firm dating for the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni, the year in which text no. 11 (Prism A) was written, might clarify matters. In any event, both Paʾê and Ummanaldašu had been taken into custody before the composition of the aforementioned inscription. The latter's capture is depicted on a relief from Ashurbanipal's palace; see Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pl. XXXIV.       160  A relief from the North Palace (Room S¹) depicts a group of Elamite kings serving Ashurbanipal; see Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pls. LXIII–LXIV. Several inscriptions record that Tammarītu, Paʾê, and Ummanaldašu, together with with the Arabian king Uaiteʾ, were hitched up to Ashurbanipal's processional carriage and pulled him on it to the gates of the akītu-house on the citadel at Nineveh during a New Year's celebration (held in the month Ṭebētu [X]); see, for example, text no. 11 (Prism A) x 17–39 and text no. 23 (IIT) lines 118–121a.       161  Baker, PNA 2/1 pp. 497–498 sub Iauta'; Baker, PNA 2/2 p. 966 sub Nuḫūru 1; Baker, PNA 3/2 p. 1353 sub Uaiate'; Berlejung, PNA 2/1 p. 600 sub Kamās-ḫaltâ; Brinkman, PNA 1/1 p. 11 sub Abī-Iate'; Brinkman, PNA 1/1 pp. 89–90 sub Aia-ammu 2; Gerardi, SAAB 6/2 (1992) pp. 67–103; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 154–155; Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 167 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.e; Tenney, PNA 2/2 pp. 938–939 sub Natnu 2; Weippert, WO 7/1 (1973) pp. 39–85; and Villard, PNA 1/1 pp. 104–105 sub Ammi-ladīn.

Text no. 9 (Prism F) does not include a report about the Arab campaigns. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 231–232 and 234–235) dates the Arabs 1 and 2 incidents to ca. 650 and ca. 644 respectively. Thanks to the efforts of I. Ephʿal, P. Gerardi, and M. Weippert, it is now fairly certain that some of the events mentioned in Grayson's Arab 1 occurred before 652, while others took place ca. 650 (during the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion). Thus, a more general date (before 652 and ca. 650) is suggested here. As for Grayson's Arab 2 incident, it clear that this took place before the composition of text no. 11 (Prism A), in the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni. Because the date of that eponym is uncertain (644, 643, or 642), a range of ca. 645–643 is given here. For further information, see the Dating and Chronology section.         162  According to text no. 11 (Prism A), Adiya, the wife of Iautaʾ, was captured at this time. The earliest inscription to record her defeat is text no. 8 (Prism G). It is uncertain if the inclusion of the Adiya incident in that inscription records new information (an event that had taken place prior to the composition of that text) or if it recorded old information (an event that had taken place years earlier but not immediately incorporated into the military narrative). Thus, Adiya was either caught by the Assyrians before 652 or in early 646.        163  In later inscriptions, text no. 11 (Prism A) and K 2802+ (Letter to Aššur), the Assyrian scribes sometimes confused Iautaʾ with the similarly named Uaiteʾ (son of Bir-Dāda). Both men were in custody ca. 645–643. For details about the confusion between these Arab rulers, see in particular the on-page note to text no. 11 (Prism A) vii 82–x 39; Gerardi, SAAB 6/2 (1992) pp. 67–71; and Lämmerhirt, RLA 14/3–4 (2014) pp. 255–256 sub Uaiteʾ.        164  The earliest dateable inscription mentioning Abī-Yateʾ's installation as ruler is text no. 3 (Prism B). It can be inferred from text no. 11 (Prism A) that Abī-Yateʾ and his brother Aya-ammu were in Babylon while it was under siege (after IV-650) and, therefore, he had to have been made ruler of the Qedarite tribes by Ashurbanipal before aiding Babylon. Thus, following more recent studies, the appointment of Abī-Yateʾ likely took place prior to 652.       165  The date is recorded in a Babylonian chronicle (Grayson, Chronicles p. 130 no. 15 line 19); see the Dating and Chronology section for a translation of the passage.       166  A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 231 and 235) dates the Arab 2 incident to ca. 644. See the comments in n. 161.       167  The punishments of Abī-Yateʾ and Natnu are not recorded in extant inscriptions. Ashurbanipal installed Natnu's son Nuḫūru as ruler of the Nabayateans.       168  Alhadeff and Jean, PNA 3/2 pp. 1309–1310 sub Tandāiu; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 155; Lämmerhirt, RLA 13/5–6 (2012) p. 441 sub Tandāja; Lapinkivi, PNA 1/1 p. 95 sub Akkudāiu; Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 167 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.f. Text no. 1 (Prism E₁) vi 1–10, text no. 2 (Prism E₂) v 1'–vi 13, text no. 3 (Prism B) iii 5–15, text no. 4 (Prism D) ii 73'–iii 8, text no. 6 (Prism C) iv 8'–18', and text no. 7 (Prism Kh) iii 31''–35''. Text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A) do not include reports about Qirbit. The Babylonian Chronicle (see below) also records this event; that text states that that city was captured in Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's accession year (=Ashurbanipal's 1st regnal year; 668).        169  Ambos and Zadok, PNA 3/1 p. 977 sub Pādê; Baker and Schmitt, PNA 2/1 p. 639 sub Kuraš; Brinkman, PNA 2/1 p. 479 sub Ḫundāru 2; Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 p. 155; Luukko, PNA 3/2 p. 1266 sub Šīlum; Ruby, PNA 1/1 p. 167 sub Aššūr-bāni-apli II.3.f.; and Waters, PNA 3/1 p. 997 sub Pislumê. Text no. 12 (Prism H) vi 1'–25', text no. 13 (Prism J) viii 1–5; text no. 21 lines 20'–21'; text no. 23 (IIT) lines 114–117 and 131b–139a. The reading of the names Šīlum and Luppi are not entirely certain. The name of the ruler of Luppi, as far as it is preserved, is [...]raBADte. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] pp. 232 and 235) dates the Cyrus and Ḫudimiri episodes to ca. 641 since “these incidents are not found in Edition A but the motive for sending the gifts is said to be an Assyrian victory over Elam, presumably Elam 8.” A more general date of ca. 642–640 is tentatively suggested here since it is not known when Grayson's Elam 8 took place, apart from that it occurred before the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni (644, 643, or 642)."

      "text": "Early in his reign, Ashurbanipal had to deal with a different type of problem than his immediate predecessors: lions, a fierce mountain breed that were reportedly killing shepherds, herdsmen, and their livestock. Dealing with such ferocious beasts had long been the prerogative of the king and it was Ashurbanipal's responsibility to help the rural inhabitants in the Arbela region. [170]    The Assyrian king appears to have laid an ambush near one of the lions' water sources. Just after daybreak, [171]   Ashurbanipal, in his chariot, sprang into action and killed the lions with arrows; inscriptions boast of the king's deadly accuracy with the bow, stating that each member of the pride was slain with only a single arrow.    The Assyrian king appears to have immensely enjoyed the experience since a few years later (sometime after 664) he went on a hunting expedition with several Elamite princes who had taken refuge in Nineveh. Ashurbanipal claims to have rescued Ummanappa when a lion jumped on him. [172]   In addition, Ashurbanipal had an arena set up in Nineveh to “hunt” and kill lions in a controlled setting and with spectators. [173]    In an area consecrated to the city's tutelary goddess, Ištar, Ashurbanipal, from his chariot, shot at lions as they were released from cages. Wounded lions that attempted to pounce on the king and his chariot team were repelled and slain with spears and swords. During a single event, eighteen lions, one for each of Nineveh's city gates, are reported to have been killed. In a religious ceremony held immediately afterwards, Ashurbanipal consecrated his victims to Ištar by pouring libations over their corpses. The Assyrian king likely staged other hunts during his long reign, as sculpted wall reliefs seem to suggest.          Notes        170  Text no. 14. For a study of the topos of the lion hunt in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, see Weissert in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 pp. 349–358 (with references to earlier literature in nn. 2–3); see also Grayson, CAH 2  3/2 pp. 158–159. For the hunting reliefs in Ashurbanipal's palace, see Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pp. 12–14, 19, 37–38, and 49–54 and pls. V–XIII and XLVI–LIX.        171  According to E. Weissert (in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 p. 346), “a well-known practice among hunters is to lay an ambush near water sources where the animals gather to drink, and since animals drink in the early hours of the day, it seems logical that Ashurbanipal tracked down the lions a short time after daybreak.”       172  A record of this hunt is known from both textual and visual sources (Room S¹ of the North Palace). See text no. 54; Bauer, Asb. pp. 87–88 and pls. 31–32 K 2867+ (the Large Hunting Inscription) lines 24–61; and Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pls. LVI–LIX. For the identification of the prince as Urtaku's son Ummanappa, see Weissert in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 p. 341 n. 7. The injuries sustained during this hunt may have prevented him later from becoming one of the rulers of Elam appointed by Ashurbanipal. Based on statements about Tammarītu, Ummanappa may have been a younger brother of Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) and an older brother of Tammarītu. For another hunt in the wild, see Frame and Grayson, SAAB 8/1 (1994) p. 5 K 6232 obv. 5'–7'.       173  The event may have been recorded on a stele erected on the hill overlooking the hunting area, just like the one shown on the reliefs from Ashurbanipal's palace (Room C) depicting the same “hunt” (Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace pp. 12–13 and pls. VI–IX); the small stele-shaped hole in the wall opposite the hill of spectators may have held a small, inscribed stele that also commemorated the event (compare, for example, the size and shape of BM 90864 [Novotny, SAACT 10 cover]). A draft of that inscription is likely found on K 6085, as argued by E. Weissert (in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 p. 351). As for the significance of the number eighteen, Weissert (ibid. p. 355) states: “The number of lions must therefore have a meaning, since it had been decided in advance to bring the spectacle to an end with the death of the eighteenth lion. This is no accident, surely, for the number of gates in the wall surrounding greater Nineveh was also eighteen. In order to trace the possible link between the number of gates in the Nineveh wall and the number of lions shot in the area, we will have to remember that when describing the plague of lions which had supposedly befallen Assyria, the author of the Great Hunting Text specifically noted that frightening lions were obstructing the roads. The conclusion is therefore unavoidable: by killing eighteen lions in the Nineveh arena, Ashurbanipal symbolically secured each exit from the capital city, every gate and road leading out of it being secured by the killing of one lion.” For a study of the narrative style of the Room C reliefs, see Watanabe, Critical Approaches pp. 352–359."

From the textual and archaeological records, this Assyrian king sponsored building programs in seven Assyrian and ten Babylonian cities: Agade, Arbela, Aššur, Babylon, Borsippa, Cutha, Dēr, Dūr-Kurigalzu, Ḫarrān, Mê-Turran, Milqʾia, Nineveh, Nippur, Sippar, Tarbiṣu, and Uruk.

      "text": "Unless it is stated otherwise, the dates given in this volume (excluding those in bibliographical citations) are all BC. Each ancient Mesopotamian year has been given a single Julian year equivalent even though the ancient year actually encompassed parts of two Julian years, with the ancient year beginning around the time of the vernal equinox. Thus, for example, the 1st regnal year of Ashurbanipal (the eponymy of Mār-larīm) is indicated to be 668, although it actually ended in early 667 and, thus, events which took place late in the ancient year “668” actually took place early in the Julian year 667.    Texts edited in this volume occasionally mention contemporary dates and the charts in this section are intended to aid the reader in understanding those dates.     The Mesopotamian month names and their modern equivalents are:         I    Nisannu   March–April   VII    Tašrītu   September–October       II    Ayyāru   April–May   VIII    Araḫsamna   October–November       III    Simānu   May–June   IX    Kislīmu   November–December       IV    Duʾūzu   June–July   X    Ṭebētu, Kinūnu   December–January       V    Abu   July–August   XI    Šabāṭu   January–February       VI    Ulūlu   August–September   XII    Addaru   February–March       VI₂    Intercalary Ulūlu     XII₂    Intercalary Addaru        The table below for the first twenty-one years of Ashurbanipal's reign, reprinted with permission from Parpola, LAS 2 pp. 382–383, attempts to precisely convert Assyrian dates to Julian ones. Although the table is styled similarly to the conversions of R. Parker and W. Dubberstein (Babylonian Chronology pp. 25–47), there is one major difference: if the new moon is visible for the first time at 7 PM on the 3rd of March, then the chart tells you that the first day of the month is the 3rd of March, not the 4th of March, as indicated by Parker and Dubberstein's charts. [175]   The dates are given as civil days, from midnight to midnight, and the dates (month/day) provided in the chart are those of the first day of each month. Based upon statements in contemporary texts and inference, S. Parpola (LAS 2 pp. 381–383) believes that in Assyria there were intercalary months in Ashurbanipal's first (XII₂), fourth (XII₂), seventh (XII₂), tenth (VI₂), twelfth (XII₂), fifteenth (XII₂), eighteenth (VI₂), and twentieth (XII₂) years on the throne.

Walker published a similar chart of the first day of each month for the second (646) to fourteenth (634) years of Kandalānu's nineteen-year reign. [176]   Although Walker's chart covers the period of Ashurbanipal's twenty-third to thirty-fifth regnal years, it is not reproduced here because it is based on the Babylonian calendar, rather than the Assyrian one. According to that table, there would have been intercalary months in Babylonia in Ashurbanipal's twenty-third (XII₂), twenty-sixth (VI₂), twenty-ninth (VI₂), thirty-first (XII₂), and thirty-fourth (XII₂) years on the throne. [177]             Notes       175  This observation was made by C.B.F. Walker, who drew this matter to S. Parpola's attention in a series of letters (September, 1984).       176  Walker in Swerdlow, Ancient Astronomy pp. 69–71.         177  According to C.B.F. Walker (in Swerdlow, Ancient Astronomy p. 70), an intercalary month is also expected for Kandalānu's sixteenth regnal year (632 = Ashurbanipal's thirty-seventh regnal year). Intercalary Ulūlu (VI2) is also attested in Kandalānu's nineteenth regnal year (629)."

      "text": "In Assyria, each eponym-year, called a  limmu  or  līmu  in Akkadian, was named after a high state official and lists of these officials (eponyms) were compiled by Assyrian scribes. The eponym list for Ashurbanipal breaks off after his 20th regnal year and, thus, the exact sequence from 648 to the end of the Assyrian empire (ca. 610) is unknown (see below for details). The following list of the eponym officials from 669–649 is based upon Millard, SAAS 2 pp. 61–62. Dated inscriptions that are included in the present volume are also noted below. A number of inscriptions whose dates may possibly be determined with some degree of confidence (e.g., instances with a clear  terminus post quem  for the inscription) are given in bold.

The reconstruction of this sequence has received a number of scholarly treatments over the years. As to be expected, every person who has attempted to order the eponyms after 648 has his/her own sequence. Therefore, the chart below presents the post-canonical eponyms in alphabetical order, with the proposed dates of M. Falkner (AfO 17 [1954–56] pp. 100–120), S. Parpola (PNA 1/1 pp. XVIII–XIX), and J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] pp. 255–265) given in the second, third, and fourth columns; a near identical chart appears in Baker, PNA 4/1 pp. 265–266. The inscriptions of Ashurbanipal edited in Part 1 dated by these eponyms are provided in the last column. Additional comments are provided in footnotes or after the chart.

This is suggested by the fact that at least two exemplars of text no. 3 (Prism B; exs. 5–6) were inscribed while Aḫu-ilāʾī held the post of eponym and one copy of that inscription (ex. 1) was written when Bēlšunu was eponym, and by the fact that three exemplars of text no. 4 (Prism D; exs. 1, 5, and 9), an inscription whose military narration is identical to text no. 3 (Prism B), were inscribed in the eponymy of Bēlšunu. Because inscriptions dated by Bēlšunu record neither the fall of Babylon nor the death of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn (after Abu [V] 648), those texts were presumably composed in the same year as those events.    It is clear from the contents of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions that Nabû-nādin-aḫi (governor of Kār-Shalmaneser) was eponym before Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu (governor of Samaria) and that Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu held that post prior to Šamaš-daʾʾinanni (governor of Babylon). Based on K 4773 (Fales and Postgate, SAA 7 pp. 77–78 no. 59), it is certain that six years separated the eponymies of the canonical Sagabbu (governor of Ḫarrān) and the post-canonical Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu. Scholars are divided on whether the six-year count is inclusive or exclusive, that is, whether the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu is five or six years after Sagabbu. This would mean that Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu was eponym in either 646 or 645. Based on careful studies of Neo-Elamite history and a closer examination of the editorial history of text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G), the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu appears to have been in 645, and not in 646, otherwise there would not be sufficient time for Ashurbanipal to wrap up affairs in Babylonia in 648 and to launch two major campaigns against Elam. [184]    Because it is unlikely that text no. 6 (Prism C) was written in the same year as text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G), [185]    it is fairly certain that the eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫi is separated from that of Bēlšunu by one year. The name of the official who was eponym in 647, the year when text no. 6 (Prism C) was inscribed on prisms, is not known. [186]   Thus, text no. 6 (Prism C) dates to 647, text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G) to 646, and text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 10 (Prism T) to 645.    Based on Ashurbanipal's annalistic texts, there is little doubt that Šamaš-daʾʾinanni (governor of Babylon) held the office of eponym shortly after Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu. The earliest and latest possible dates are 644 and 640 respectively since text no. 11 (Prism A) was composed after text no. 9 (Prism F), which is dated by the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu (dated here to 645), and before text no. 12 (Prism H), which is dated in the Babylonian fashion to Ashurbanipal's 30th regnal year (639). It is generally assumed that text no. 11 (Prism A) was not written more than one, two, or three years after text no. 9 (Prism F) and, thus, Šamaš-daʾʾinanni may have been eponym in 644, 643, or even 642. [187]    Although it cannot be proven with certainty, the eponymy of this governor of Babylon may have been separated from that of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu by at least one year (643), rather than following it immediately. The scant evidence is as follows:      Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) sent the corpse of Nabû-bēl-šumāti to Nineveh towards the end of Duʾūzu (IV) of the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu (645). Because Ashurbanipal claims to have hitched up that Elamite king, together with other rulers, to his chariot during an  akītu -festival held at Nineveh (in the month Ṭebētu [X]), it seems unlikely that there was sufficient time (five months) for (1) the Elamites to rebel against him and (2) for Assyrian troops to locate Ummanaldašu, who reportedly was hiding in the mountains in eastern Iran, capture him, and bring him all the way back to Nineveh, especially since the Assyrians had been unable to capture that fugitive Elamite king on two previous occasions. [188]       Ashurbanipal appears to have been rebuilding Ištar's  akītu -house at Nineveh in the middle of the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu (645); the two known dated copies of text no. 10 (Prism T) were inscribed on the sixth of Abu (V) and the twenty-fourth of Ulūlu (VI). Assuming prisms inscribed with copies of this text were deposited in the structure of that temple, then Ashurbanipal would have had only three months to wrap up construction before performing an  akītu -festival in Ṭebētu (X). It is unlikely that the king's workmen could have finished building the superstructure, roofing the temple, hanging doors in its principal gateways, and lavishly decorating its interior in such a short time. [189]      According to text no. 11 (Prism A), Ashurbanipal's troops departed the city Damascus only in the month Abu (V) on their long journey into the Arabian desert to pursue rulers who had instigated anti-Assyrian behavior among their people. Presumably it took some time to capture the fugitive rulers and bring them back to Nineveh. If Ashurbanipal's claims to have hitched up Uaiteʾ to his processional carriage during an  akītu -festival held at Nineveh, then that campaign would have had to have been completely wrapped up by the month Kislīmu (IX) since New Year's festivals at Nineveh were held in Ṭebētu (X). [190]      Text no. 11 (Prism A), assuming it provides accurate information, states that the Assyrians conquered Ušû (mainland Tyre) and Akko on their return march from Arabia. If that proves true, then those military actions would have had to have been concluded well before scribes started writing text no. 11 (Prism A) on prisms at the very beginning of the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni; one copy, assuming it does not involve a ceremonial ante-dating, was inscribed on the first of Nisannu (I).      Thus, it seems likely that Šamaš-daʾʾinanni was eponym in the year 643 at the earliest. However, because it cannot be proven with absolute certainty that the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni did not immediately follow that of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu, 644 cannot be entirely ruled out of consideration. Since other events are included in text no. 11 (Prism A) — for example, the death of Gyges of Lydia and the receipt of an audience gift from Sarduri III of Urarṭu — a later date (642 or even 641 or 640) is also possible for this governor of Babylon's tenure as eponym. The eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni is tentatively dated here between 644 and 642, with preference given to 643 (or 642).       Notes       178  J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] p. 258), following a suggestion by R. Whiting, believes that Bēl-šaddûʾa is not the same man as Bēl-Ḫarrān-šaddûʾa, who was eponym in 650.       179  K. Kessler (Studies Parpola p. 109) and R. Mattila (Studies Parpola p. 159 n. 3) argue against J.E. Reade's proposed dating.       180  J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] p. 259) proposes that Pašî was an alternate name used for Nabû-tappûtī-alik at Aššur.       181  J. Novotny (Kaskal 11 [2014] p. 164 n. 11) suggests that the eponymy of Saʾīlu must come before that of Bēl-aḫu-uṣur since it is unlikely that Sîn-šarra-iškun's Cylinder A Inscription was written on cylinders several years after that king's clay cone inscription. This arrangement of the eponyms follows those of Falkner and Reade.       182  This eponym date appears on BM 122613, a fragment of a clay cylinder. J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] p. 257), following the proposal of A.R. Millard (Iraq 30 [1968] p. 111), believes this piece belongs to the same cylinder as BM 122616+ (text no. 21) and, thus, dates it near the end of Ashurbanipal's reign (634). Following E. Weissert ( apud   Borger, BIWA p. 356), this fragment more likely dates to the reign of Sîn-šarra-iškun and, therefore, Sîn-šarru-uṣur, governor of Ḫindānu, is presumed here to have been eponym while Sîn-šarra-iškun was on the throne.       183  J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] p. 258) suggests that the palace scribe Sîn-šarru-uṣur died during the year that he was eponym and that Nūr-ṣalam- ṣar pi replaced him; Reade reads the name as Nūr-ṣalam- kas pi. Moreover, he postulates that the hapax Sîn-šarrūssu-ukīn is Sîn-šarru-uṣur.         184  See Frame, Babylonia pp. 293–295; Novotny, SAOC 62 p. 128; and Waters, SAAS 12 pp. 117–118.         185  For details, see Novotny, SAOC 62 p. 128 and the commentary to text no. 6 (Prism C).        186  J. Novotny (SAOC 62 p. 128), following M. Falkner (AfO 17 [1954–56] p. 118), tentatively suggests that Nabû-daʾʾinanni (governor of Que) was eponym for the year 647. Of course, there are numerous other possibilities, apart from Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu and presumably Nabû-nādin-aḫi.       187  The year 643 is the most commonly assigned date for Šamaš-daʾʾinanni's tenure as eponym. See, for example, Gerardi, Assurbanipal's Elamite Campaigns p. 72; Tadmor, Proceedings of the 25th International Congress p. 240; and Waters, SAAS 12 p. 79 n. 58. A.K. Grayson (ZA 70 [1980] p. 245) and G. Frame (Babylonia pp. 222 and 271) tentatively give a date of ca. 643–642. J.E. Reade (Orientalia NS 67 [1998] p. 256) prefers the year 644. Earlier and later dates have been proposed. For example, S. Parpola (PNA 1/1 p. XVIII) dates the eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni to 645, while S. Melville (Chavalas, ANE p. 360) suggests 639, and M. Falkner (AfO 17 [1954–56] p. 118) places it in 636.        188  The quick succession of events may have been possible only (1) if the Elamites rebelled immediately after learning that Ummanaldašu sent Nabû-bēl-šumāti's corpse to Nineveh to appease Ashurbanipal and (2) if Assyrian troops (perhaps under the direction of Bēl-ibni) were already in the region and pursued the deposed Elamite king as soon as he fled his capital.        189  There were two  akītu -houses at Nineveh: one in the citadel and one north of the Nergal Gate. The older of the two, and the one that Ashurbanipal was rebuilding, was in the citadel, probably near Emašmaš, the temple of Ištar/Mullissu. The newer temple (Ešaḫulezenzagmukam; “House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year”) was built anew by Sennacherib (ca. 690) outside the city wall, a little north of the Nergal Gate. It is probable that Sennacherib never finished work on that building and this may be the reason why Ashurbanipal decided to renovate the original  akītu -house at Nineveh. For details, see Frahm, NABU 2000 pp. 75–79 no. 66; and Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/1 p. 22. Further information on this building will be provided in the introduction of Part 2.        190  It is not impossible for everything to have been wrapped up by the beginning of Ṭebētu (X). The impression given by Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, however, is that the campaign took some time to complete and, therefore, it is plausible that this military expedition concluded after the month Ṭebētu (X)."

Notes       191  The chronicles recording the rise of Nabopolassar and the end of Assyria under Sîn-šarra-iškun (Grayson, Chronicles pp. 87–96 nos. 2–3) will be translated in the introduction of Part 2 since those texts provide information of Ashurbanipal's successors, who have not been treated in the introduction of Part 1.       192  J.A. Brinkman (Studies Moran pp. 73–104) and E. Weissert (CRRA 38 p. 273 n. 1) prefer to treat this chronographic text as made up of three separate recensions rather than duplicates; J.-J. Glassner (Chronicles pp. 193–203 no. 16 and pp. 202–207 no. 17) similarly prefers to treat this text as two separate recensions.       193  Or possibly “ twenty-fourth  day.” See Brinkman, Studies Moran p. 90 n. 90.       194  The date conflicts with the scribal note written on K 2411 (Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/2 p. 231 no. 162 rev. iii 39'–40'), which states that the bed was returned on the twenty-seventh day of Simānu (III) of the eponymy of Awiānu (655). Therefore, the 14th year mentioned in the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn Chronicle appears to be a mistake for the king of Babylon's 13th regnal year; note, however, that Marduk's bed was returned during Ashurbanipal's 14th year as king (= the eponymy of Awiānu).       195  As A.K. Grayson (Chronicles p. 129) points out, some form of the city Aššur is to be restored in the break. Baltil, written (URU.) bal-til .KI, seems the most likely option since Aššur is always written KUR  aš-šur  (without KI). This reading of the line follows Millard, Iraq 26 (1964) p. 15.       196  The date seems to conflict with one inscription of Ashurbanipal: Text no. 61 (EȘ 6699), which is dated to Tašrītu (VII) of the eponymy of Awiānu (655), records the decoration of this new chariot. Thus, it is possible that the 15th year mentioned here refers to Ashurbanipal's 15th regnal year, rather than Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's, and, therefore, a mistake for the king of Babylon's 14th regnal year.       197  A.R. Millard (Iraq 26 [1964] p. 15) restores [LUGAL TIN.TIR].KI (“[the king of Babylon]”) after Šamaš-šuma-ukīn's name. As correctly pointed by A.K. Grayson (Chronicles p. 129), this is very unlikely since the use of a title after a royal name is rare in late Babylonian chronicles.       198  J.-J. Glassner (Chronicles pp. 212–213) restores [ALAN] (“[the statue of]”); this follows the suggestion of A.R. Millard (Iraq 26 [1964] p. 15).       199  After “the officials of A[ssyria],” A.K. Grayson (Chronicles p. 129) suggests the restoration [BAL.MEŠ- ma ] (“[ rebelled ]”); J.-J. Glassner (Chronicles pp. 212–213), following his suggestion, restores [ is-ḫu ] (“[ revolted ]”).       200  A.R. Millard (Iraq 26 [1964] p. 15) restores  a [ na  URU. šá-pi-i - d ]EN “t[o the city Ša-pī]-Bēl.”       201  The conjectural restorations in line 13 follow Grayson, Chronicles p. 129; A.K. Grayson's readings follow Millard, Iraq 26 (1964) p. 15.        202  The reading  ma-na-ma  (“anyone”) at the end of line 16 is uncertain. See the comments of A.K. Grayson (Chronicles p. 130).       203  Possibly read “troops of Assyria.” A.K. Grayson (Chronicles p. 130) suggests that the sign before KUR  aš-šur  could be ERIM."

Sixteen clay prism fragments, all of which are presumed to have come from Nineveh, are among the inscribed objects bearing early official texts of Assyria’s last great king. These pieces are exemplars of three or four different inscriptions. Two of these fragmentary texts are generally referred to as “Prism E₁” and “Prism E₂” in scholarly literature and they are often assumed to have been composed ca. 666–665 and ca. 665–664 respectively. Despite their poor state of preservation, both texts likely recorded Ashurbanipal’s nomination as heir designate of Assyria and his subsequent education in the House of Succession, his first campaign to Egypt, the conquest of the city Qirbit, and the voluntary submission of the Lydian king Gyges; reports of the latter event differ significantly in the “Prism E” recensions. In addition to the variant versions of how Gyges became an Assyrian vassal, it is certain that the building reports of the two “Prism E” texts were different: one recorded the rebuilding of the House of Succession at Nineveh, while the other described the reconstruction of (parts of) the citadel wall. All of the identifiable early prism fragments of Ashurbanipal are tentatively edited here as text nos. 1 (Prism E₁), 2 (Prism E₂), 14, and 15; for further details, see the commentaries of these inscriptions.       1    Fragments of at least three different clay prisms preserve parts of one of the earliest versions of Ashurbanipal’s annals. This text included descriptions of Assyrian troops (with the aid of twenty-two Cypriot and Levantine rulers) defeating the Pharaoh Taharqa and his supporters, the capture of the city Qirbit, and the receipt of payment from Gyges of Lydia (on the instructions of the god Aššur that he had received in a dream). The prologue likely included an account of the nomination of Ashurbanipal as heir designate and a statement about his training in the House of Succession. The building report, at least in one exemplar, records that Ashurbanipal rebuilt the House of Succession at Nineveh, which his grandfather had (re)built; later inscriptions (text nos. 9 [Prism F] and 11 [Prism A]) record that his father Esarhaddon was born in that palace and that Ashurbanipal grew up there. Although none of the certain exemplars preserves a complete date, scholars generally think that this text, which they designate as “Prism E₁,” dates to around Ashurbanipal’s third or fourth regnal year (ca. 666–665); the  terminus ante quem  is the second Egyptian campaign, which took place after Tanutamon succeeded Taharqa as pharaoh in Egypt.

Sources:   (1)  K 01821         (2)  A 07920 + A 08138         (3)  A 08130      Commentary   Ashurbanipal appears to have had his scribes write out the earliest versions of his annals (text nos. 1–2 and 14–15) on clay prisms with six, seven, or eight sides. With regard to this text (Prism E₁), ex. 1 is a hexagon, while exs. 2–3 are heptagons.     The ‘annals’ edition known as “Prism E” was first identified by G. Smith (Assurbanipal p. 78) in 1871. However, it was not until over a century later that M. Cogan and H. Tadmor correctly pointed out that that inscription was actually two different texts, which they labelled as E₁ and E₂. For further details on the relationship between the two Prism E inscriptions, see Cogan and Tadmor, Orientalia NS 46 (1977) pp. 65–85; and Weissert and Onasch, Orientalia NS 61 (1992) pp. 58–73. K 1821, A 7920+, and A 8130 are generally regarded as the main E₁ exemplars, and BM 121018+, BM 127923+, BM 127940+, BM 128306+, and BM 134454 are usually considered as the principal E₂ exemplars. These pieces are edited respectively as text no. 1 exs. 1–3 and text no. 2 exs. 1–5. Given the poor state of preservation of these two versions of the annals, it is uncertain if the five fragments K 1828, Bu 89-4-26,151, BM 121029+, A 8140, and 81-7-27,263 are exemplars of text no. 1 (Prism E₁) or text no. 2 (Prism E₂). These pieces are tentatively edited in this volume as text no. 2 exs. 1*–5*. Furthermore, three additional fragments sometimes assigned to Prism E — 82-5-22,21, BM 99326, and BM 128302+ — are edited separately as text no. 15, a hitherto unclassified edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals that was composed between 663 and 649, rather than as exemplars of one of the E Prisms; for this opinion, see Weissert and Onasch, Orientalia NS 61 (1992) p. 73 n. 46; and Novotny, Orientalia NS 72 (2003) pp. 211–214. E. Weissert (in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 pp. 357–358) proposed that K 1821 (ex. 1) and 82-5-22,2 likely belonged to one and the same six-sided clay prism. Based on the reconstruction of Prism E₁ in this volume, that non-physical join has been rejected and, therefore, 82-5-22,2 has been edited separately as text no. 14 (see below).     As far as the Prism E inscriptions are preserved, the prologues, the accounts of the first campaign to Egypt, and the reports of the conquest of the city Qirbit appear to have been identical in text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂); at this time, there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. The description of the voluntary submission of the Lydian king Gyges and the building reports, however, differ significantly. Because the accounts of how Gyges became an Assyrian vassal are very poorly preserved in both Prism E₁ and Prism E₂ and because reports of this event differs significantly from later, better preserved inscriptions, there are major complexities in reconstructing the Gyges narrative in text nos. 1 and 2. In 1977, Cogan and Tadmor (Orientalia NS 46 [1977] pp. 65–85) reconstructed both inscriptions as six-sided prisms and provided schematic drawings showing the proposed distribution of the known fragments. According to their reconstruction of Prism E₁ (this text), the extant parts of the Gyges narrative are preserved at the tops of cols. iv (= K 1821 i´) and v (= K 1821 ii´ and A 7920 i´); the end of the building report and the beginning of the concluding formulae appeared at the top of col. vi (= A 7920 ii´). The distribution of the contents of this part of the inscription was based solely on K 1821 (ex. 1) since the top of that hexagonal prism is preserved. Following the proposed reconstruction of Cogan and Tadmor, the lower four-fifths of cols. iv, v, and vi are completely missing and, therefore, there are very long lacunae (1) between the opening lines of the Gyges report (top of col. iv) and the description of problems that the Assyrian royal court had with translating the Lydian ruler’s message when his envoy arrived in Nineveh (top of col. v); and (2) between the passage recording the arrival of the Gyges’ messenger in the Assyrian capital (top of col. v) and the building report (which would have began at the bottom of col. v). In 1995, Weissert (in Parpola and Whiting, Assyria 1995 p. 340 n. 6) proposed that K 1821 (ex. 1) and 82-5-22,2 (text no. 14) could belong to one and the same six-sided clay prism because the width of the columns, the substance of the clay, and the spacing of the signs appear to have been the same on both pieces and because from “the historiographical point of view, the hunting episode in 82-5-22,2 fits remarkably well into an intermezzo-like passage following the military narrative [of K 1821], since this is exactly the place where the motif of the royal hunt had normally been integrated into the ‘annals’ of the Assyrian kings during the 11th–9th centuries BCE.” Thus, the contents of 82-5-22,2 (lion hunt and  akītu -festival near Arbela) would have appeared in col. v, between the end of the Gyges narrative and the beginning of the building report. According to the 1977 reconstruction of Cogan and Tadmor, there would be enough room for the contents of 82-5-22,2 in Prism E₁ (this text) col. v.    Given the fact that many of the positively identified E prisms are seven-sided, rather than six-sided (for example, exs. 2–3 of this text and text no. 2 [Prism E₂] exs. 1 and 4), Cogan and Tadmor’s proposed reconstruction of the distribution of the contents of Prism E₁ (this text) and Weissert’s proposed non-physical join between K 1821 (ex. 1) and 82-5-22,2 (text no. 14) are not as secure as one would like. It is certain that the narrative recording the arrival of Gyges’ envoy at Nineveh appeared in the penultimate column (=col. vi) of both A 7920+ (ex. 2) and A 8130 (ex. 3). Because a date is partially preserved on A 8130, it is likely that that fragment comes from near the bottom of the prism, and since the contents of A 7920+ ii´ and A 8130 ii´ partially overlap, A 7920+ may also originate from near the lower half of a prism. Therefore, given that the contents of A 7920+ i´ partially duplicate the six-sided K 1821 ii´ (ex. 1), K 1821 should probably be regarded as preserving the first lines of cols. v and vi of a hexagonal prism, rather than those of cols. iv and v as Cogan and Tadmor suggest. Assuming that exs. 1–3 are all exemplars of one and the same inscription and that both A 7920+ (ex. 2) and A 8130 (ex. 3) come from the lower halves of the prisms to which they belong, then Weissert’s proposed non-physical join between K 1821 (ex. 1) and 82-5-22,2 (text no. 14) seems less likely since there might not have been enough space for a report about a lion hunt and an  akītu -festival between the Gyges narrative and the building report. It is impossible to know with absolute certainty because it is unclear how many lines were inscribed in each column of this inscription, depending on whether it was written in six or seven columns; it is assumed here that each prism had roughly 60–70 lines per column. Therefore, it is best to edit 82-5-22,2 separately, and it is assigned as text no. 14 in this volume.     Based on J. Novotny’s understanding of the known pieces of this text and text no. 2 (Prism E₂), the contents of the seven-sided version of Prism E₁ may have been roughly distributed as follows: i–iii (top) = prologue; iii (upper half)–v (middle) = first Egyptian campaign; v (middle)–vi (top) = expedition against Qirbit; vi (upper half)–vii (upper half) = Gyges narrative; vii (middle) = building report; vii (lower half) = concluding formulae; and vii (bottom) = date. The six-sided version would have differed from this, perhaps: i–ii (upper three-quarters) = prologue; ii (bottom)–iv (upper half) = first Egyptian campaign; iv (lower half)–v (top) = expedition against Qirbit; v (upper half)–vi (upper half) = Gyges narrative; vi (middle) = building report; vi (lower half) = concluding formulae; and vi (bottom) = date. Following exs. 2 and 3, this text is tentatively reconstructed here as a heptagon, rather than a hexagon.    None of the three positively identified exemplars is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in vi 1–15 and 3´–10´; ex. 2 in vi 1´–2´, 11´–23´, and vii 1´–23´; and ex. 3 in vi 24´–31´ and vii 24´–25´. The numerous restorations are as follows: the expedition against Qirbit (vi 1–10) is restored from text no. 2 (Prism E₂) and the so-called “Large Egyptian Tablets” Inscription (Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 81–83 no. 20); and the building report and concluding formulae (vii 1´–25´) are restored from text nos. 3 (Prism B), 4 (Prism D), and 11 (Prism A).

This inscription, which is commonly referred to as “Prism E₂,” also includes reports of the defeat of Taharqa and his supporters in Egypt, the conquest of the recalcitrant city Qirbit, and the voluntary submission of Lydia’s ruler Gyges. The account of how Gyges became Ashurbanipal’s vassal in this text is significantly different from the version found in text no. 1 (Prism E₁). Moreover, the building report describes a different construction project at Nineveh: repairs made to (a section of) the citadel wall, for which Sennacherib is cited as a previous builder.

Exs. 1, 4, and 4* may have all been seven-sided clay prisms; ex. 1* is either a hexagonal or heptagonal prism; ex. 2* is probably a six-sided prism; and exs. 2 and 3* may have been heptagonal or octagonal prisms.    In 1977, M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (Orientalia NS 46 [1977] pp. 69–74) reconstructed Prism E₂ as a six-sided prism and provided a schematic drawing showing the proposed distribution of the known fragments. According to their reconstruction of this text, the extant parts of the Gyges narrative are preserved in the lower half of col. v (= BM 134454 i´, BM 128306+ iii´, BM 121018 iii´, and BM 127923+ i´) and in the upper part of col. vi (BM 134455 i´). That proposed reconstruction more or less still stands today. However, the lacuna between BM 134454 i´ (ex. 5) and BM 128306+ iii´ (ex. 4) and BM 121018 iii´ (ex. 1) is much larger than it is shown in Cogan and Tadmor’s schematic reconstruction (ibid. p. 69 fig. 2). Moreover, BM 121018 iii´ (ex. 1) and BM 127923+ i´ (ex. 2) do not hold the same position in the narrative: the contents of BM 121018 iii´ (ex. 1) come before those of BM 127923+ i´ (ex. 2). It is unclear given the current state of preservation of Prism E₂ (this text), whether the contents of BM 121018 iii´ (ex. 1) and BM 128306+ iii´ (ex. 4) slightly overlap those of BM 127923+ i´ (ex. 2) or if there is a very short gap between them. Given the distribution of the Gyges narrative on the identified pieces, a marginal overlap, rather than a lacuna of just a few lines, seems more plausible, although this cannot be proven with certainty. The same may have been the case for BM 134455 i´ (ex. 3) and BM 134454 ii´ (ex. 5).    Following exs. 1, 4, and 4*, this text is tentatively reconstructed here as a heptagon, rather than a hexagon. Based on the J. Novotny’s understanding of the known pieces of this text and text no. 1 (Prism E₁), the contents of the seven-sided version of Prism E₂ may have been roughly distributed as follows: i–iii (top) = prologue; iii (upper half)–v (middle) = first Egyptian campaign; v (middle)–vi (top) = expedition against Qirbit; vi (upper half)–vii (upper half) = Gyges narrative; vii (middle) = building report; vii (lower half) = concluding formulae; and vii (bottom) = date. The six-sided version would have differed from this, perhaps: i–ii (upper three-quarters) = prologue; ii (bottom)–iv (upper half) = first Egyptian campaign; iv (lower half)–v (top) = expedition against Qirbit; v (upper half)–vi (upper half) = Gyges narrative; vi (middle) = building report; vi (lower half) = concluding formulae; and vi (bottom) = date.     No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in iv 1–12, 30´–v 12, 29´–vi 13, and 7´–15´; ex. 2 in vi 1´´–vii 6; ex. 3 in i 1–14, 1´–5´, and vii 7–15; ex. 4 in iv 5´–19´, v 1´–28´, and vi 1´–6´; ex. 5 in vi 14–25 and vii 1´–8´; ex. 1* in iii 6–23, iv 1´–4´, and 20´–29´; ex. 2* in iii 1´–9´; ex. 3* in ii 1–9, iii 1–5, 1´´–6´´, and iv 13–17; and ex. 4* in ii 1´–7´. The numerous restorations are as follows: the prologue is restored from text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A);  the reports of the first Egyptian campaign and the expedition against Qirbit are restored from text no. 1 (Prism E₁) and the so-called “Large Egyptian Tablets” Inscription (Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 81–83 no. 20); and the building report is restored from text no. 4 (Prism D).

It is, however, not the case for Ashurbanipal’s third decade as king, starting with this version of his annals, copies of which were inscribed on eight-sided clay prisms during his twentieth and twenty-first regnal years (649–648; respectively, the eponymies of Aḫu-ilāʾī, governor of Carchemish, and Bēlšunu, governor of Ḫindānu). At least six prisms, and presumably many more, bore a lengthy inscription that divided its military narration into eight campaigns and recorded the rebuilding of a wing of the armory at Nineveh that his grandfather Sennacherib had constructed anew. Following the model of his earlier inscriptions (as well as those of his father Esarhaddon), this text, which is frequently referred to as “Prism B” in Assyriological publications, arranges the “campaigns” ( girru s) geographically, and not chronologically. Ashurbanipal boasts that he defeated Egypt twice, forced Baʾalu of Tyre into submission, captured the city Qirbit, destroyed numerous cities in Mannea, fought many successful battles against various Elamite rulers (especially the arrogant and belligerent Teumman), conquered the Gambulian capital Ša-pī-Bēl and deported its anti-Assyrian leaders (Dunānu and his brothers), and plundered Arab tribes. Numerous other details are provided, including, for example, Yakīn-Lû of Arwad, Mugallu of Tabal, and Sanda-šarme of Ḫilakku (Cilicia) voluntarily sending tribute, along with their daughters; Gyges of Lydia defeating invading Cimmerians and sending a substantial payment to Assyria; Urtaku of Elam, Bēl-iqīša of Gambulu, and Urtaku’s eunuch Marduk-šuma-ibni all dying from unusual circumstances within the same year; Aḫšēri of Mannea, Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) of Elam, and Tammarītu of Elam all being deposed; and Kamās-ḫaltâ of Moab capturing Ammu-ladīn of Qedar and handing him over to Assyria.

The main difference between this inscription and text no. 4 (Prism D) is that the building report of this text (at least in ex. 5) describes work undertaken on a wing of the armory and that of text no. 4 records repairs made to the citadel wall. It should be noted here that the building reports of ex. 1 of this text (Prism B) and ex. 1 of text no. 4 (Prism D) are not preserved. Nevertheless, K 1775+ is edited here as a certain exemplar of this inscription and K 1741+ as a certain exemplar of text no. 4. Although the building reports of exs. 2–4 and 6 are very poorly preserved, they appear to record work on the armory, just like ex. 5.    There are two different versions of the concluding formulae: One appears in ex. 5 (the basis for the master text), and the other in exs. 3 and 6; exs. 2 and 4 do not preserve enough to be able to determine which version of the inscription they follow. Full details about these significant editorial variations are provided in the on-page notes.    In addition to the six principal exemplars, numerous other prism fragments may be inscribed with copies of this text, rather than some other (earlier or later) inscription of Ashurbanipal. These are edited here as exs. 1*–147*. Exs. 1*–137* could also be exemplars of text no. 4 (Prism D); exs. 138*–142* could bear copies of text nos. 4 (Prism D), 6 (Prism C), 8 (Prism G), or 11 (Prism A); exs. 143*–144* could actually be exemplars of text nos. 4 (Prism D), 6 (Prism C), 8 (Prism G), 9 (Prism F), or 11 (Prism A); exs. 145*–146* could bear copies of texts nos. 4 (Prism D) or 9 (Prism F); and ex. 147* could be a copy of texts nos. 4 (Prism D) or 11 (Prism A). These pieces, despite their uncertain attribution to this inscription, are included in the score and their minor (orthographic) variants are noted with this text. Moreover, these fragments are used to reconstruct the master text of passages in which the principal exemplars (exs. 1–6) are not preserved; see below for details.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in i 1–31, ii 1–13, 32–64, iii 1–21, 30–59, iii 82–iv 28, 42–52, 84–v 20, 33–52, 73–82, vi 2–16, 52–61, vii 1–15, 37–49, and 81–viii 34; ex. 4 in i 34–42; ex. 5 in i 43–73, 86–94, ii 70–93, iii 60–81, iv 29–41, 53–83, v 21–32, 53–72, 83–90, vi 21–51, vii 24–36, 50–80, and viii 35–92; ex. 6 in i 74–85, 95, ii 65–69, v 91–vi 1, and 62–84; ex. 28 in vi 85; ex. 32* in i 32–33; ex. 71* in ii 14–31 and iii 23–30; ex. 92* in vi 86–90; ex. 110* in vi 17–20; and 126* in vii 16–23. The column and line numbering of R. Borger’s edition of Prism B in BIWA generally follows that of A.C. Piepkorn (Asb.); see Borger, BIWA p. 86. There are relatively few completely damaged words and signs in the master text. When possible, these signs are restored from text no. 4 (Prism D); otherwise, the restorations come from text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 10 (Prism T). A complete score, including the exemplars of uncertain attribution, is presented on Oracc. The numerous orthographic variants that appear in this text are listed at the back of the book. Also, since the lineation of the present edition differs from the one given in Borger, BIWA, a concordance of line numbers is provided at the back of the book.

The prologue and military narration of this inscription, which is generally called “Prism D” in earlier publications, is identical to that of text no. 3 (Prism B), apart from a few minor textual variants. At least three of the exemplars of this text were inscribed during the post-canonical eponymy of Bēlšunu, governor of Ḫindānu (648).

Note that the surfaces of the extant columns of ex. 17 are slightly rounded, rather than flat as one expects for a normal clay prism; A 8009 should not be regarded as a vertical cylinder because its columns are angled 31–32 degrees, like a ten-sided prism. Text no. 9 (Prism F) ex. 6 (BM 121008+) also has marginally rounded surfaces; see the commentary of that inscription.    As far as the exemplars are preserved, there are only minor (orthographic) variants in the prologue and military narration. However, there is significant variation in the building report and concluding formulae. The account of the rebuilding and expansion of the citadel wall of Nineveh in exs. 3, 7–8, 11, and 15 is fourteen words longer than it is in exs. 2, 10, and 16–17; the former group includes viii 65–67, whereas the latter group does not. The building reports are not sufficiently preserved in the other exemplars to be able to determine which version they follow. Since none of the exemplars in question preserves a date, one cannot be absolutely certain that the copies with the longer building report were inscribed later than those with the shorter one. However, because the building report of exs. 3, 7–8, 11, and 15 states that Ashurbanipal strengthened the foundations of the citadel wall with limestone blocks and made it thicker and higher than it had been in the reign of Sennacherib, these copies of Prism D may have been inscribed later than exs. 2, 10, and 16–17. Of course, one cannot rule out the possibility that exs. 2, 10, and 16–17 are later in date and contain an abridged version of the rebuilding of the citadel wall. Moreover, there are also at least two different versions of Ashurbanipal’s advice to future rulers (viii 75–93): The first is found in exs. 1, 8, 12, and 14, while the second appears in exs. 5–6 and 9. Given the fact that only ex. 8 sufficiently preserves both a version of the building report and the king’s advice, it is not possible to make any firm conclusions about how the different building accounts correlate to the different advice passages. Further details about these editorial differences are provided in the on-page notes.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in iv 11´–32´, 35´–v 1´, 15´´–46´´, 50´´–vi 4, 35´–82´, vii 22–53, 63–91, and viii 83–93; ex. 2 in i 1–63, ii 1´–11´, vi 7´–26´, vii 1–21, 54–61, viii 4–64, and 68–73; ex. 3 in i 79–ii 4, 45´–63´, iii 15–25, 1´–iv 13, 33´–34´, v 1´–9´, 1´´–14´´, 47´´–49´´, vi 1´–6´, and 86´–92´; ex. 4 in ii 12´–32´, iii 26–64, and iv 1´–10´; ex. 5 in i 64–73 and ii 64´–74´; ex. 6 in i 74–78; ex. 7 in ii 33´–44´ and viii 65–67; ex. 8 in viii 74–82; ex. 9 in ii 5–10 and iii 1–14; and ex. 17 in vi 27´–34´. The column and line numbering of R. Borger’s edition of Prism D in BIWA generally follows that of A.C. Piepkorn (Asb.); see Borger, BIWA p. 86. The restorations are based on text no. 3 (Prism B), with a little help from text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 7 (Prism Kh). A full score of the inscription is presented on the CD-ROM and all of the numerous minor (orthographic) variants are listed at the back of the book, in the critical apparatus. In addition, because the lineation of the present edition differs significantly from the one given in Borger, BIWA, a concordance of line numbers is provided at the back of the book.    Numerous other prism fragments may be inscribed with copies of this text, rather than some other (earlier or later) inscription of Ashurbanipal. These are edited as text no. 3 (Prism B) exs. 1*–147*. For further details, see the catalogues and commentaries of that inscriptions. Moreover, it is possible that ex. 13 (BM 98629) could actually be an exemplar of text no. 8 (Prism G). Despite this uncertainty, that piece is tentatively edited here as a positively identified exemplar of this text.    Bibliography      1870 3 R pl. 27 (ex. 3, partial copy)   1871 G.

Unlike other extant prism inscriptions of his, this text does not contain any military narration; the absence of campaign reports is commonly attested for Ashurbanipal’s Babylonian inscriptions, but not for his Assyrian ones. The lengthy prologue — which, as far as it is preserved, is identical (apart from minor variants) to those of text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 8 (Prism G) — provides information on the following projects: (1) the completion and decoration of the Aššur temple at Aššur, Eḫursaggalkurkurra (“House of the Great Mountain of the Lands”); (2) the completion of Esagil (“House whose Top is High”), the temple of Marduk at Babylon, and the return of the statues of Babylon’s tutelary deities; (3) the refurbishing and creation of ornate cult objects for Marduk and his consort Zarpanītu; (4) the  setting up of statues of wild bulls in prominent gateways of Nabû’s temple at Borsippa, Ezida (“True House”); (5) the decoration of the Ištar temples at Nineveh (Emašmaš) and Arbela (Egašankalama, “House of the Lady of the Land”) (passage not preserved); (6) the refurbishing of a (forgotten) image of the goddess Šarrat-Kidmuri and the reinstitution of her cultic rites (not preserved): (7) the setting up of lion-headed eagles and divine emblems in Egalmeslam (“Palace, Warrior of the Netherworld”), the temple of Nergal at Tarbiṣu; and (8) the rebuilding of the temple of the moon-god Sîn at Ḫarrān, Ehulhul (“House which Gives Joy”), and the construction of its (twin) Emelamana (“House of the Radiance of Heaven”), the temple of Nusku. In addition, Ashurbanipal boasts that he had metal (silver, gold, and bronze) images made of himself and had them placed in the presence of his divine benefactors. The building report records the renovation and subsequent decoration of the Sîn-Šamaš temple at Nineveh, which had last been worked on by his father Esarhaddon; the building’s Sumerian ceremonial name is not known and its archaeological remains have not yet been positively identified. One exemplar of this inscription, which was formerly referred to as “Prism TVar[iant]” (or “T-Type”) and is now sometimes called “Prism I,” was inscribed during the post-canonical eponymy of Bēlšunu, governor of Ḫindānu (648), around the same time as some copies of text no. 4 (Prism D).

In earlier Assyriological literature, this text is referred to as “T-Type” (Cogan, JCS 32 [1980] p. 149 n. 10) or “T Variant” (“TVar” for short; Borger, BIWA pp. 134–136) since its contents most closely resembled the “Thompson Prism” (text no. 10 [Prism T] ex. 1). Because the inscription is a clearly definable edition, and not a sub-edition or variant of another prism class, including “Prism T,” J. Novotny (Studies Walker p. 192 n. 6) suggested Prism I as a suitable replacement.     The non-physical join between BM 134464 and BM 134479 (ex. 4) was recognized on the basis of the hand (same scribe), color (deep orange), and composition of the clay. Exs. 5–10 should probably be regarded as exemplars of this inscription, rather than text no. 10 (Prism T), on the basis of one or more of the following characteristics: (1) the color (deep orange) and composition of the clay (which is similar to exs. 1, 3, and 4); (2) very large script; (3) very wide columns; and (4) textual variants, particularly in the passage describing the circumstances in which Ashurbanipal came to rebuild Eḫulḫul (“House which Gives Joy”), the temple of Sîn at Ḫarrān.     The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The inscription is reconstructed here as a pentagonal prism with an estimated 50–55 lines per column. The line arrangement follows ex. 1 in v 1–24; ex. 2 in iv 1–17; ex. 3 in iii 1´–23´ and iv 20–38; ex. 4 in col. i, iv 39–42, and v 25–36; ex. 8 in ii 1–8; ex. 9 in ii 27´–44´; and ex. 10 in iii 25´–30´. Restorations are generally based on text no. 10 (Prism T), but also on text nos. 3 (Prism B), 6 (Prism C), and 7 (Prism Kh) when necessary. A score is presented on Oracc.

That inscription is known from at least four badly damaged ten-sided clay prisms. Its prologue and much of its military narration were borrowed (with modifications and additions) from earlier versions of Ashurbanipal’s annals, including all of the five previous inscriptions (text nos. 1–5). This text’s prologue is more or less identical to text no. 5 (Prism I) — which records construction in five Assyrian cities (Aššur, Arbela, Ḫarrān, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu) and two Babylonian cities (Babylon and Borsippa) — and its descriptions of the king’s victories generally duplicate those of text nos. 3 (Prism B) and 4 (Prism D), apart from the new report about the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion (652–648) and events in Elam (648), including Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) deposing Indabibi; note that some passages in the first Egyptian campaign report (against Taharqa) were borrowed from earlier inscriptions, including text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂). With regard to the events of the Babylonian rebellion, this inscription records that the siege ended when the gods cast Šamaš-šuma-ukīn into a fire; this vague statement could imply either that the king of Babylon took his own life or that he was murdered by one or more of his officials. Moreover, some of the harsh and heart-breaking conditions that Babylon’s citizens had to endure while their city was besieged, including having to resort to cannibalism, are explicitly recorded. Although little of the building report is preserved, it is generally assumed that that passage recorded the renovation of a wing of the armory at Nineveh that Esarhaddon constructed since Ashurbanipal is known to have worked on that palace (text no. 3 [Prism B]), since Esarhaddon is named a previous builder, and since the word  ekallu  (“palace”) appears in the concluding formulae. Scholars usually refer to this inscription as “Prism C”; one copy of this text (ex. 3b) was previously referred to as “Prism G” and “Prism K.” Although no certain exemplar of this text preserves a date, it is generally thought that the inscription was written on clay prisms during the year after the fall of Babylon, in 647 (possibly the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-daʾʾinanni, governor of Que).

For many years, K 1794+ (ex. 1) and K 1703 (ex. 3b) were regarded as belonging to different versions of this king’s annals; the former was designated as “Prism C,” while the latter was called “Prism G” (by T. Bauer) and then “Prism K” (by A.C. Piepkorn). R. Borger (BIWA p. 126), however, has satisfactorily proved that K 1703 (Bauer’s “Prism G” and Piepkorn’s “Prism K”) and K 1794+ (“Prism C”) both bear one and the same version of Ashurbanipal’s annals. Borger describes his discovery as follows: “Cogan + Tadmor, OrNS 50, 229ff. und Cogan, JCS 41 96ff. haben „Prism K“ weitere Texte zugewiesen, wobei es ihnen allerdings offensichtlich schwer fiel, „K“ und C sauber voneinander zu trennen. Dies war kein Wunder, denn K 1703 ist einfach ein Textvertreter von Prisma C! Die beiden für „K“ typischen Passagen, eingebaut nach B VI 82 bzw. wie seit 1987 (Sumer 44 152 n4, siehe dazu Weissert, NABU 1990 n126) nachweisbar, unmittelbar nach B VII 76, durfte man in C VII Mitte bzw. VIII Mitte erwarten, aber gerade dort klafften in C, auch noch nach Freedmans Bearbeitung, grosse Lücken. Diese Tatsache sowie der Umstand, dass K 1703 wie C 10kolumnig ist (IWA p8 korrekt! Piepkorn äussert sich nicht zur Kolumnenzahl), hätten die korrekte Identifizierung von K 1703 bereits ermöglicht. Als ich im Juli 1991 ND5411+ (unten CND8) abschrieb, traf ich dort den ersten für „K“ typischen Passus an ; hier folgt nach B VII lf. nicht B VII 3, sondern C VII 120, womit Zugehörigkeit zu C erwiesen war. Freedman VIII „x+ 1“–„x+6“ (Zusatzstück zu Cl) konnte ich als Reste des zweiten für „K“ typischen Passus identifizieren (bei mir C VIII 70ff.). Nachdem ich CND8 abgeschrieben hatte, wurde es mir alsbald klar, dass sämtliche Assurbanipal-Prismen aus Nimrud zur Prismenklasse C gehören müssen (CND1–15). Weissert hatte übrigens bereits mit dem Gedanken gespielt, dass sie alle zu C gehören konnten, und keines zu B.” Following Borger, K 1794+ and K 1703 are both regarded as exemplars of “Prism C.” However, based on J. Novotny’s (SAOC 62 p. 128) recent examination of the original of ex. 1, it is certain that the military narration of Borger’s “Prism CKalach” (or “Prism CND”) does not duplicate that of this text. The Kalḫu version of the annals includes a report of the first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), whereas the military narration of this text (Prism C) does not (see below). Therefore, Ashurbanipal’s Nimrud annals are edited separately as text no. 7 (Prism Kh); moreover, its designation has been changed to “Prism Kh.”    Novotny (SAOC 62 p. 128, with nn. 6–7) carefully examined the numerous fragments of K 1794+ (ex. 1) and concluded that there was not sufficient space for an account of his fourth Elamite campaign in that prism since there is a lacuna of approximately twenty-three lines at the end of col. ix and a gap of about eighteen lines at the beginning of col. x. The proposed forty-one missing lines perfectly corresponds to the expected number of lines missing from the descriptions of the campaigns against the Arabs; the lacuna between ix 52´´ and x 1´ corresponds to text no. 3 (Prism B) vii 77–viii 23. Given the fact that it would require an additional ninety to one hundred lines to narrate the first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldašu, one must conclude that K 1794+ (ex. 1) could not have included a report of that campaign in its military narration. Based on this critical reassessment of the original of K 1794+, it is certain that (1) the  terminus ante quem  for this text is the fourth Elamite campaign; (2) a report of Ashurbanipal’s first war against Ummanaldašu was recorded for the first time in text no. 7 (Prism Kh), and not in this version of the annals; and (3) K 13778 (Borger’s C16) is an exemplar of text no. 8 (Prism G; ex. 4) since it includes an account of the Elamite campaign in question. Moreover, this text was probably composed one year earlier than text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G), and not in the same year; for example, see Borger, BIWA p. 257. Novotny (SAOC 62 p. 128), based on this new information, dates the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫi to 646 since there should be one year separating it from the eponymy of Bēlšunu, which most scholars generally date to 648. Unfortunately, because the date lines are not preserved on K 1794+ (ex. 1), it is uncertain who held that position in 647. Novotny (Eḫulḫul p. 17; and SAOC 62 p. 128), following M. Falkner (AfO 17 [1954–56] p. 118) tentatively suggests that Nabû-daʾʾinanni was the eponym-official for that year. For further information, see the Dating and Chronology section of the book’s introduction.    Borger (BIWA pp. 122–127) assigned sixteen certain exemplars to this edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals. Although this may be true, some of the smaller fragments could actually bear copies of text no. 8 (Prism G) and, therefore, these pieces are tentatively included here as exemplars of uncertain attribution (exs. 1*–11*). Five further small fragments are included here; exs. 12*–16* could be exemplars of this inscription, text no. 8 (Prism G), or text no. 11 (Prism A). In addition, eight possible exemplars of this text are edited as text no. 3 (Prism B) exs. 138*–144* and text no. 8 (Prism G) ex. 1*. For further details on those pieces, see the catalogues of those two inscriptions.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in i 2´–55´, 67´–98´, 1´´–9´´, ii 8´–18´, 73´–85´, 1´´–4´´, iii 1´–18´, 39´–71´, iv 1´–18´, 1´´–21´´, 28´´–35´´, v 8–25, 57–68, vi 21´–32´, 23´´–39´´, vii 4–22, 37–53, 35´–48´, viii 1´–20´, 1´´–24´´, 1´´´–3´´´, ix 1´–24´, 1´´–52´´, x 1´–20´, 1´´–21´´, and 1´´´–28´´´; ex. 2 in i 1´, 56´–61´, ii 1´–7´, 19´–53´, iii 19´–38´, 72´–99´, iv 22´´–27´´, 36´´–84´´, v 30–56, 69–107, and vi 1´–20´; ex. 3 in vi 33´–38´, 7´´–22´´, vii 1´–23´, and viii 4´´´–21´´´; ex. 4 in vii 29´–34´;  ex. 1* in i 62´–65´ and ii 59´–65´; ex. 4* in ii 54´–58´; ex. 8* in iii 104´–iv 1; ex. 9* in v 1–6 and 1´–2´; ex. 10* in vi 1´´–6´´; ex. 11* in vii 26–35; ex. 14* in ii 66´–72´; and ex. 16* in ii 7´´–19´. The column and line numbering of Borger’s edition of Prism C in BIWA generally follows that of R.D. Freedman (St. Louis); see Borger, BIWA pp. 122–123. When possible, the restorations are generally based on text nos. 7 (Prism Kh) and 8 (Prism G) and, when they are not, they stem from text no. 3 (Prism B). In a few places, restorations have been made from text nos. 4 (Prism D), 5 (Prism I), 10 (Prism T), and 11 (Prism A). A complete score of the text, including the exemplars of uncertain attribution, is presented on Oracc. The numerous orthographic variants that appear in this text are listed in the critical apparatus. Moreover, because the lineation of the edition given here differs from that of Borger, a concordance of line numbers is given at the back of the book.

This text’s prologue and most of its military narration, apart from one new campaign report, duplicate verbatim (with minor orthographic variants) those sections of the previous inscription (text no. 6). This Nimrud version of the annals records Ashurbanipal’s first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III; probably in 647) and describes the renovation of (part of) Nabû’s temple at Kalḫu; the early Neo-Assyrian king Adad-nārārī III (810–783) is named as a previous builder of Ezida. One exemplar (ex. 1) was inscribed in the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫi, governor of Kār-Shalmaneser (probably 646); for the date, see the introduction and the commentary of text no. 6 (Prism C). This text is sometimes referred to in previous scholarly literature as “Prism CKalach,” “Prism CND,” or “Prism K[alac]h”; it is designated “Prism Kh” in this volume.

At present, it is unclear how many different exemplars of this text are extant. There could be as many as sixteen copies of it or as few as two or three. It is certain that the following exemplars do not come from the same object:  exs. 1 and 2; exs. 1 and 4; exs. 1 and 6; exs. 1 and 7; exs. 1 and 15; exs. 2 and 9; exs. 3 and 5; exs. 3 and 10; exs. 3 and 11; exs. 4 and 12; exs. 6 and 14; exs. 9 and 11; and exs. 10 and 14. R. Borger (BIWA p. 129) rightly suggests that exs. 4 and 10–11 could be parts of one and the same prism since their script (same hand), color, and composition of clay are very similar. It is likely that ND 5526, an uninscribed fragment from the bottom of a prism (Knudsen, Iraq 29 [1967] p. 67), joins ex. 2. ND 4326 (ex. 13) was identified by G. Van Buylaere in the British Museum. The authors thank her for bringing this to their attention.      Following Borger, all of the prism fragments discovered at Kalḫu are considered here as belonging to one version of Ashurbanipal’s annals. Because Borger thought that the prologue and military narration of this text and text no. 6 (Prism C) were identical, he designated this inscription as “Prism CKalach” (or “Prism CND”). However, J. Novotny’s (SAOC 62 p. 128) recent examination of the original of K 1794+ (text no. 6 ex. 1) has proven that this was not the case since this version of the annals from Kalḫu contained a lengthy report of Ashurbanipal’s fourth Elamite campaign, whereas that (earlier) text from Nineveh did not; for details, see the commentary of text no. 6 (Prism C). For this reason and because its building report records work on Nabû’s temple Ezida, rather than the armory at Nineveh, this inscription has been assigned the new designation “Prism Kh”; “Prism K” has been intentionally avoided so that there is no confusion with A.C. Piepkorn’s now-obsolete designation “Prism K” (which was used to describe K 1703, text no. 6 [Prism C] ex. 3b). A report of the first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldašu is recorded in this inscription for the first time. The prologue and military narration of this text most closely parallels those of text no. 8 (Prism G), which was also inscribed on prisms during the eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫi (probably 646). For details on the major differences between Prisms Kh and G, see the commentary of text no. 8, as well as Novotny, SAOC 62 pp. 130–132.    Providing a reliable edition of this inscription is hampered by the fact that over half of the published pieces are accessible only from the published copies of E.E. Knudsen (Iraq 29 [1967] pls. XIV–XXIX) and M. Mahmud and J. Black (Sumer 44 [1985–86] pp. 151–152 nos. 2–4) or from hand-written transliterations of Borger (BIWA 4 o -Heft pp. 273–275). Because those fragments are housed in the collections of the Iraq Museum (Baghdad), it was not possible to examine them from the originals. Because Knudsen did not consistently reproduce the fragments at the same scale, it is not always possible to confirm with certainty the many proposed physical or non-physical joins. The Kalḫu pieces that are in “Deposit 1307” of the British Museum (London), however, were collated against the originals. Generally speaking, based on Novotny’s examination of the fragments of this text now in the British Museum, Knudsen’s copies are reasonably reliable, which bodes well for the pieces that he copied that ended up in Baghdad. Despite these obstacles, it is possible to produce a fairly accurate, modern edition of this text.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in i 1´–49´, ii 1´–37´, 14´´–16´´, vi 4´´–22´´, 26´´–vii 14, 35´–viii 12, 91´–104´, 112´–ix 15, 1´–19´, 7´´–x 12, 1´–63´, 65´–85´, and 87´–90´; ex. 2 in i 50´–101´, ii 17´´–60´´, iii 5´´–24´´, iv 97´´–98´´, x 64´, and 86´; ex. 3 in iii 1´–46´, iv 3´´–35´´, iv 43´´–71´´, v 35–103, and vi 1´–46´; ex. 4 in iv 1´–12´, 77´´–96´´, v 1–34, 104–vi 21, 1´´–3´´, 23´´–25´´, and vii 15–45; ex. 5 in iv 72´´–74´´ and vii 19´–31´; ex. 6 in vii 1´–17´, viii 17´–89´, and ix 1´´–6´´; ex. 7 in i 1–6, viii 105´–111´, and x 13–17; ex. 8 in ii 1´´–11´´; ex. 9 in iii 25´´–35´´; ex. 10 in iv 1´´–2´´; ex. 11 in iii 1´´–4´´ and iv 36´´–40´´; ex. 12´ in iv 13´–26´; ex. 13 in viii 1´–16´; ex. 14 in vii 18´ and 32´–34´; and ex. 16 in x 21–27. The column and line numbering of Borger’s edition of Prism Kh in BIWA generally follows that of R.D. Freedman (St. Louis); see Borger, BIWA pp. 122–123. When possible, the restorations are generally based on text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 8 (Prism G) and, when they are not, they stem from text no. 3 (Prism B). In a few places, restorations have been made from text nos. 4 (Prism D), 5 (Prism I), 10 (Prism T), and 11 (Prism A). A complete score is presented on Oracc and a list of minor (orthographic) variants is provided at the back of the book.

In addition to some alterations in the military report — including the reordering of the reports of Ashurbanipal’s first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) and his skirmishes with various Arab groups — this inscription includes a brief description of the defeat and capture of the Arabian queen Adiya. The building report states that Ashurbanipal rebuilt and widened Nineveh’s wall, just like he did in text no. 4 (Prism D). The best preserved exemplar (ex. 1) was inscribed sometime during the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-nādin-aḫi, governor of Kār-Shalmaneser (probably 646). Although the month (and day) that the prism was written are completely missing, it is assumed that this recension of the annals was issued shortly after that of text no. 7 (Prism Kh). This suggestion is based on the editorial changes in the descriptions of Ashurbanipal’s victories, including the addition of the account of Adiya’s capture into the narrative of the events in Arabia of this text. In more recent scholarly publications (starting in 1996), this inscription is occasionally referred to as “Prism G.”    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003707/]   or the  score  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q003707/]  of Ashurbanipal 08.

This edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals was first correctly identified by R. Borger (BIWA pp. 130–131). He gave it the designation “Prism G”; this newly-assigned designation should not be confused with T. Bauer’s “Prism G” (= K 1703; Asb. [1933] p. 28), which is actually an exemplar of text no. 6 ([Prism C] ex. 3b). M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (Orientalia NS 50 [1981] pp. 229–240) assigned A 8111 (+) BM 134436 (ex. 1) as an exemplar of their “Prism K” (= Bauer’s “Prism G”), but as Borger has already confirmed, those fragments are actually pieces of this text’s principal exemplar (ex. 1). For further information on the classification of K 1703, see the commentary of text no. 6 (Prism C) and Borger, BIWA pp. 126 and 130–131.    A careful re-examination of the contents of this inscription and text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 7 (Prism Kh), reveals that the military narration of this text most closely parallels that of text no. 7, but with a few minor and major alterations; these were recently noted by J. Novotny (SAOC 62 pp. 130–132). The more notable textual alterations are: (1) the scholar(s) responsible for this edition added one line to the description of the torture of Mannu-kî-aḫḫē and Nabû-uṣalli in Arbela, as well as expanding the statement about the Gambulian ruler Dunānu’s execution in Nineveh (vii 1´´–9´´); (2) this text provides some additional information on why the Elamite king Tammarītu was deposed (viii 23´´b–32´´); (3) this version of Ashurbanipal’s annals adds a short passage stating that the Arabian queen Adiya was defeated and captured (ix 1´´–6´´); and (4) the order of the reports of the first war against the Elamite king Ummanaldasu (Humban-ḫaltaš III) and the Arabian campaigns were switched by placing the former after the latter.    With respect to ex. 1, the majority of its fragments come from the lower half of the prism, especially A 8011 (+) A 8104 (+) A 8137 since the base is partially preserved. A 7982 + A 7985 + A 8012 + A 8107 + A 8117 + A 8151 + A 8162 appears to have been part of the upper half or middle of the object, as suggested by the estimated lacuna between the various fragments; the sizes of the gaps are based on the line counts of the better preserved text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 7 (Prism Kh). After examining both BM 134436 and A 8111 of ex. 1, the authors (especially Novotny) are less certain about the proposed non-physical join. Nevertheless, both pieces are tentatively regarded here as belonging together. Most of the text of A 8107, what little is preserved, is unreadable. Because its contents cannot be identified or firmly placed within the inscription, this piece is not included in the edition. Note that all of the ex. 1 fragments remain unjoined in the Oriental Institute (Chicago); gluing them together would not only be very problematic, but also impractical and would likely further damage the pieces.     Ex. 2 also comes from the lower portion of a large prism; this is certain because its base is partially preserved. Although ex. 3 does not duplicate ex. 1, this piece clearly does not come from the same object since the space between its columns is too wide and since the lines of col. i´ are written askew, at an angle of approximately 9–11 degrees.     In general, the lineation and master text follow ex. 1. When possible, the restorations are generally based on text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 7 (Prism Kh) and, when they are not, they stem from text no. 3 (Prism B). In a few places, restorations have been made from text nos. 4 (Prism D) and 10 (Prism T). Scores of vii 40´–51´, viii 15´´–29´´, viii 1´´´–22´´´, and x 1´–16´ are provided on Oracc. The few attested orthographic variants are noted at the back of the book.    In addition to the five certain exemplars, there are numerous other prism fragments that might bear copies of this inscription. One of these (A 8128) is edited here as ex. 1*. Because the contents of col. i´ are not preserved in text no. 6 (Prism C), but partially duplicate the preserved text of ex. 3, that fragment is edited here rather than with that earlier version of Ashurbanipal’s annals. In addition, text no. 3 (Prism B) exs. 138*–144*, text no. 4 (Prism D) ex. 13, and text no. 6 (Prism C) exs. 1*–16* may be exemplars of this inscription, rather than some (earlier or later) inscription.

This text is presently attested on two nearly complete clay prisms and approximately two hundred fragments of clay prisms and vertical cylinders discovered at Nineveh and Aššur; the latter object type is not otherwise attested as a medium for Assyrian royal inscriptions (see the commentary for details). The king’s scribe(s) responsible for the composition of this inscription reworked the contents of all of the earlier reports of the military campaigns, greatly abridging the contents of those passages; moreover, for the first time (as far as it is possible to tell), entire campaign accounts were omitted (see below). In addition, the lengthy prologue that had been used for many inscriptions during the previous three years (648–646) was abandoned in favor of a shorter introduction that solely provided details about Ashurbanipal’s nomination as heir designate of Assyria and his royal training in the House of Succession; for example, compare i 1–33 of this inscription to text no. 6 (Prism C) i 1´–ii 3´ and text no. 7 (Prism Kh) i 1–101´. The reworked and updated military narration was divided into six campaign reports. These are: (1) the second Egyptian campaign, during which Tanutamon was defeated and Thebes was thoroughly plundered; (2) the forcing of Baʾalu of Tyre into submission, along with the voluntary submission of several Anatolian and Levantine rulers (including Gyges); (3) the conquest of several important Mannean cities, which brought about a coup against their ruler Aḫšēri; (4) the defeat and beheading of the Elamite king Teumman, the capture of the Gambulian capital Ša-pī-Bēl, and the violent dethronements of Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) and Tammarītu in Elam; and (5–6) the two wars against Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) of Elam, during the second of which the Elamite royal city Susa was looted and destroyed. Accounts of the first Egyptian campaign (against Taharqa), the conquest of the city Qirbit, the war against Urtaku of Elam, the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion, and the battles against various Arabian rulers were not included in the narrative. With regard to the second war against Ummanaldašu (the fifth Elamite campaign; probably 646), Ashurbanipal states that he brought out of Susa a statue of the goddess Nanāya — along with numerous other royal and divine objects looted from Babylonia or sent there as bribes by former kings of Babylon, including his own brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn — returned her to her rightful place in Uruk, and (re)installed her in her temple Eḫiliana (“House of the Luxuriance of Heaven”). Nanāya is reported to have resided in Elam 1,635 years, which would imply that her statue had been carried off during the Old Akkadian period. The revamped prologue, which borrows some of its material from texts composed during Ashurbanipal’s first decade as king (including text nos. 1 [Prism E₁] and 2 [Prism E₂]), directly ties into the focus of the building report: the construction of a replacement House of Succession at Nineveh. In addition to providing numerous details about the new palace, including the construction of a Syrian-style portico (a  bīt-ḫilāni ), Ashurbanipal claims to have created a botanical garden, just as his father Esarhaddon and his grandfather Sennacherib had done when they had built palaces. Numerous exemplars (including exs. 1–2) are dated to the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu, governor of Samaria (probably 645). As far as the dates are preserved, the prisms and cylinders were inscribed during the second to fifth months of the year (from Ayyāru to Abu).

07116         Commentary    Copies of this inscription, just like text nos. 6 (Prism C) and 11 (Prism A), were discovered at Nineveh and Aššur. Most of the certain exemplars are written on six-, seven-, and eight-sided clay prisms; the best known copy (ex. 1, the “Louvre Prism”) is a hexagon. However, fifteen copies (exs. 7, 29, 32, 35–36, 57, 96, 146–147, 154, 160–161, 164, 172, and 204) are found on (hollow) vertical cylinders, an unusual medium for Assyrian royal inscriptions that perfectly blends the format of the prism with that of the horizontal cylinder; that format is presently only attested for this text. Like prisms, the basic shape of the vertical cylinders was created using a coil technique. R. Borger (BIWA 4 o -Heft p. 87) did not regard ex. 36 (A 8022) as a proper cylinder, stating: “Oberfläche stark gewölbt, obwohl kein richtiger Zylinder.” This assessment is not correct and A 8022, in the authors’ opinion, should be regarded as a vertical cylinder. Why the medium did not catch on or why it was used in the first place cannot be answered at this time. Ex. 6 (BM 121008+) is a little unusual in shape: its ends (at least its bottom) are slightly tapered, giving the prism a slightly ‘barrel’ shape. Ex. 26 (BM 128231+) is also not a standard-shaped prism: its columns are slightly curved and its base is very rounded, so much so that this prism would not have been able to stand upright, as already noted by Borger (BIWA 4 o -Heft p. 425). Note that the surfaces of the columns of text no. 4 (Prism D) ex. 17 are also slightly curved.    The three fragments published by V. Scheil (Prisme pp. 43–44 and 48, and pls. 6–7; = exs. 36, 44, and 48) in 1914 were classified by M. Streck (Asb. pp. CDLXXXI and 834–835) as “Prism F” in 1916. In 1933, when T. Bauer published his edition and copy of ex. 2 (Asb. pp. 3–8 and 30 and pls. 1–5), the inscription’s designation was changed to “Prism A a ” since this version of the annals was regarded as a later, highly abbreviated recension of text no. 11 (Prism A). Later that same year, using numerous fragments in the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago that E. Chiera had purchased from a dealer in Mosul, A.C. Piepkorn (Asb. pp. IX, 3, and 8) was able to establish that Streck’s “Prism F” was the same text as Bauer’s “Prism A a ” “down to a few signs”; he even identified several sub-editions (which he labelled F, F₂, F₃, F₄, and F₅). A few years later, E. Weidner (AfO 13 [1939–41] pp. 207–210) correctly pointed out that Prism F was composed earlier than text no. 11 (Prism A), and not after it, as Bauer had thought. Weidner postulated that this inscription had been written about eight to ten years earlier than text no. 11 (Prism A). Most scholars today, however, generally think that not more than one to three years separate the two inscriptions; for details, see the Dating and Chronology section.    Compared to many of the extant prism inscriptions of this Assyrian king, most of which are badly damaged, this text appears to have an unusually large number of exemplars that contain significant textual variants; a few of these were first recognized by Piepkorn (Asb. pp. IX, 3 and 8). M. Cogan (JCS 29 [1977] pp. 97–107; JCS 35 [1983] p. 146) proposed that there were seven recensions of Prism F, including the main version. He labeled these F and F₂–F₇; these should not be confused with Piepkorn’s similarly labeled F₂–F₅. All of the textual variants noted by Cogan occur in the prologue (i 1–33) and in the report of the second war againt the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) (iv 17–vi 21). F₂ is represented by exs. 17, 21, 26, 48, 144, and 156; F₃ by exs. 42, 47, 49, and 210; F₄ by exs. 2, 79, and 206; F₅ by exs. 32 and 98; F₆ by ex. 191; and F₇ by K 3404+ (a multi-column tablet edited in Part 2). However, J. Jeffers (ZA 108 [forthcoming]) provides a critical and thorough evaluation of Cogan’s recensions of this text. He notes that Cogan omits numerous exemplars that belong as witnesses to more than one proposed “recension” group (particularly with his F₃ and F₄ categories), and that Cogan’s assessment is hindered by the fact that he only evaluates the passages in Prism F containing a major departure from the master text without including several other places in the inscription in which smaller, but important textual variations occur. Jeffers shows that all of the passages attesting to significant variation from the master text are shared among a specific group of exemplars, and he argues that these exemplars represent a first version of Prism F that was then updated and expanded in order to create the final version of Prism F (as represented by the master text). Thus, the materials that are lacking in these exemplars are not “deletions” or “omissions” (as they are commonly described), rather they represent an original, shorter version of the inscription that was then edited into its final version. The exemplars he ascribes to this first version of Prism F are: 2, 10, 26, 34, 38, 47, 49–51, 79, 82, 142, 145, 149, 175, 206, 210–211, and possibly 46, 126, and 196. His discussion of these variants to the master text is found in the on-page notes.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies significantly between the numerous exemplars. Because exs. 1 and 2 are fairly complete, the master text is generally based on those two exemplars. The line count in cols. i and iii differs marginally from earlier editions, including Borger’s (BIWA pp. 14–76); for details, see the concordance of line numbers at the back of the book. A complete score of the text, including the exemplars of uncertain attribution (see below), is presented on Oracc. The many orthographic variants that appear in this text are listed at the back of the book.    Numerous other prism fragments may be inscribed with copies of this text, rather than some other (earlier or later) inscription of Ashurbanipal. Forty-one of those are edited here as exs. 1*–41*. Exs. 1*–3* could also be exemplars of text nos. 10 (Prism T) or 11 (Prism A); and exs. 4*–41* might be inscribed with copies of text no. 11 (Prism A). Four other prism fragments might contain this text; these are edited as text no. 3 (Prism B) exs. 143*–146*. For further details, see the catalogue of that text. Exs. 1*–41*, despite their uncertain attribution to this inscription, are included in the score and their minor (orthographic) variants are noted with this text.

Unlike the previous inscription (text no. 9 [Prism F]), this text’s prologue utilized the temple-building prologues of several earlier inscriptions (text nos. 5–8), but with some omissions, abbreviations, and additions. The most notable changes are: (1) the passages describing how the gods endowed Ashurbanipal with extraordinary intelligence and how he completed temples begun by his father Esarhaddon were omitted: (2) the report describing the wealth of abundance during Ashurbanipal’s reign was significantly abbreviated; (3) a ten-word account of the reconstruction of Edimgalkalama (“House, Great Bond of the Land”), the temple of Great Anu (Ištarān) at Dēr, was added; and (4) the building report of text no. 5 (Prism I), which records the construction of the Sîn-Šamaš temple at Nineveh, was incorporated. The sole report of Ashurbanipal’s victories on the battlefield included in this inscription, an account of his fifth Elamite campaign, is a greatly abbreviated version of the report that had been composed anew for text no. 9 (Prism F). Apart from the mention of Nanāya returning to her temple Eḫiliana (“House of the Luxuriance of Heaven”), no reference is made to the vindictive destruction and plundering of Susa. The building report states that Ashurbanipal had one of the  akītu -houses of Ištar/Mullissu at Nineveh rebuilt and lavishly decorated; the New Year’s temple in question was the one that was inside the citadel and that had been last renovated by his great grandfather Sargon II, and not Ešaḫulezenzagmukam (“House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year”), the entirely new  akītu -house that his grandfather Sennacherib had starting building outside the city wall, just north of the Nergal Gate. Two exemplars (exs. 1–2) bear dates stating that they were inscribed in the post-canonical eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu, governor of Samaria (probably 645), during the fifth (Abu) and sixth (Ulūlu) months of the year. This inscription is commonly referred to by scholars as “Prism T[hompson].”    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003709/]   or the  score  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/Q003709/]  of Ashurbanipal 10.

Most of the fragments that make up BM 121006 were discovered beneath the floor of the southeast door of the Nabû temple (Ezida, “True House”), except for BM 127889, which comes from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II (Ap. B. 33), near the lower fall. Details on the two  akītu -houses will appear in the introduction of Part 2; some information is provided in Frahm, NABU 2000 pp. 75–79 no. 66, and Grayson and Novotny, RINAP 3/1 p. 22. For details on the date with which exs. 1 and 2 were inscribed (the eponymy of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu, governor of Samaria), see the Dating and Chronology section of the book’s introduction.    Like text no. 5 (Prism I), copies of this inscription of Ashurbanipal were written on pentagonal and hexagonal prisms. As one expects, the arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. The master text generally follows ex. 1 (the “Thompson Prism”), with help from the other exemplars or from text nos. 5 (Prism I), 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 9 (Prism F). A score of the text is presented on Oracc and the minor (orthographic) variants are listed at the back of the book. The few attested major variants, including one in the building report of ex. 18, are mentioned in the on-page notes, along with other comments about the editorial history of Ashurbanipal’s annals and summary inscriptions.    Ex. 1* is a small prism fragment that could belong to a text of either Ashurbanipal or Sennacherib, though the lineation fits best with this inscription of Ashurbanipal. A few other prism fragments may be inscribed with copies of this text, rather than some other (earlier or later) inscription of Ashurbanipal. These are edited as text no. 9 (Prism F) exs. 1*–3*. For further details, see the catalogues and commentaries of those inscriptions.

This text is the longest extant late Neo-Assyrian inscription (ca. 1,300 lines) and, at present, is inscribed on two damaged, but mostly complete, ten-sided clay prisms and approximately one hundred and eighty prism fragments. The scribe(s) responsible for its composition not only made full use of the contents of earlier inscriptions — especially text nos. 6 (Prism C), 7 (Prism Kh), and 9 (Prism F) — but also wrote out a great deal of new material, even for accounts of the king’s earliest campaigns. Unlike text no. 9, this version of the annals included reports of every campaign led by the king or one of his eunuchs, at least those that had been deemed worthy of recording in official texts. In addition to the events described in the military narration of text nos. 1–4 and 6–10, this inscription recorded significant achievements that had taken place after (or perhaps even simultaneous with) the fifth Elamite campaign, including the voluntary submission of the Elamite king Paʾe, the capture of the fugitive Elamite ruler Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), and the successful expedition against the Arabs, during which the troublemakers Uaiteʾ, Abī-Yateʾ, and Aya-ammu were taken captive, brought back to Assyria, and punished; the Urarṭian king Ištar-dūrī (Sarduri III) is also reported to have made friendly overtures by sending gifts and cordial letters. Ashurbanipal had his (team of) scribe(s) also include a few details about an  akītu -festival (New Year’s celebration) held at Nineveh: He states that he had three Elamite kings (Tammarītu, Paʾe, and Ummanaldašu) and one Arabian leader (Uaiteʾ) hitched up like horses to his processional carriage and had them pull it to the main gateway of temple of Ištar/Mullissu (Emašmaš). The inscription’s prologue and building report respectively concern themselves with Ashurbanipal’s appointment as Esarhaddon’s successor in Assyria and the construction of a new House of Succession at Nineveh, which he transformed into his own palace. The text’s composer(s) reworked and expanded material in both passages that had been composed anew for text no. 9 (Prism F). A few new details are provided about Ashurbanipal’s efforts to build himself a new royal residence: Workmen used wagons that had been brought back as plunder from Elam to transport bricks and several unnamed Arabian kings are said to have served as common laborers. Four exemplars (exs. 1–4) preserve dates and at least three of them were inscribed in the post-canonical eponymy of Šamaš-daʾʾinanni, governor of Akkad/Babylon, during the first (Nisannu), second (Ayyāru), and sixth (Ulūlu) months of the year. It is uncertain, however, if Šamaš-daʾʾinanni’s eponymy immediately followed that of Nabû-šar-aḫḫēšu or whether it was separated from it by one or two years; thus, “Prism A” could have been written on clay prisms during either 644, 643, or 642.

inscription has several exemplars that contain textual variants, especially in the description of the construction of the king’s new palace at Nineveh, there are significantly fewer variants attested for this text than for text no. 9 (Prism F). Even when variants are attested, these alterations are relatively minor. The non-orthographic variants are noted in the on-page notes; as usual, the plethora of orthographic variants are listed at the back of the book. A full score of the inscription is presented on Oracc.    The identification of the House of Succession ( bīt ridûti ) with the North Palace stems from W.K. Loftus’ (1854) and H. Rassam’s (1878) discovery of two nearly perfect prisms in the ruins of that poorly preserved royal residence. Ex. 1 (the so-called “Rassam Cylinder”) was transported to the British Museum (London) more or less undamaged, but ex. 2 (which is also known as “Cylinder A”) broke into numerous fragments en route to London; a considerable portion of that exemplar has been lost. For details on the discovery of these two large ten-sided prisms, see, for example, Rassam, Asshur pp. 33–34 and 221; G. Smith, Records of the Past 1 p. 57; G. Smith, 3 R p. 7; and Borger, BIWA pp. 1–3.    R. Borger (BIWA p. 323) edits K 1706F, K 1706G, K 1706I, and K 1706K as independent fragments. However, J. Jeffers was able to join K 1706I and K 1706K to ex. 2; the former at x 48´–50´ of the exemplar [= x 105–106 of the master text], and the latter at i 6´´´–8´´´ [= i 74–76 of the master text]. Furthermore, given that so many of the fragments containing the identification “K 1706” belong with ex. 2, the fragments K 1706F and K 1706G are tentatively edited with ex. 2 as well.    The small prism fragment K 14981 is edited with this text (ii 9–14) as ex. 1*, though its contents also parallel text no. 2 (Prism E₂) v 11–12, text no. 6 (Prism C) iii 1´–5´, and text no. 7 (Prism Kh) ii 55´´–60´´ (cf. the Large Egyptian Tablets Inscription obv. 58´–63´ [Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 82–83 no. 20]); thus, it may belong to one of those inscriptions instead. Exs. 178–179 and 1* were identified by E. Jiménez in the British Museum. The authors thank him for bringing them to their attention.    Numerous other prism fragments may be inscribed with copies of this text, rather than some other (earlier) version of Ashurbanipal’s annals. These are edited as text no. 3 (Prism B) exs. 138*–144* and 147*, text no. 6 (Prism C) exs. 12*–16*, and text no. 9 (Prism F) exs. 1*–41*. For further details, see the catalogues and commentaries of those inscriptions.    For some details about a few non-standard sign forms used by Ashurbanipal’s scribes — especially the SAR, BÀD, and NUNDUM signs in ex. 1 — see Borger, BIWA pp. 1–2. Following the model of earlier RINAP and RIM publications, the edition and score of this text does not differentiate between normal SAR signs (those starting with three horizontal wedges) and those written using the EZEN sign (which starts with two horizontal wedges), the BÀD sign when it begins with three horizontal wedges (rather than with two), the NUNDUM sign (KA×NUN) when it is written using the SU₆ sign (KA×SA), and the normal DU₆ sign when it is written as DUL (which omits the winkelhaken). Those interested in these minor paleographic variants (where they occur and in which exemplars), can consult Borger, BIWA pp. 14–76 (and  passim  in the microfiches).    As mentioned in the Dating and Chronology section of the book’s introduction, as well as in the introduction to this text (see above), there is no scholarly consensus on when Šamaš-daʾʾinanni, governor of Akkad/Babylon, was eponym.

The badly damaged prologue, as far as it is preserved, recorded several of Ashurbanipal’s building projects at Babylon (Esagil, “House whose Top is High”), Borsippa (Ezida, “True House”), and Cutha (Emeslam, “House, Warrior of the Netherworld”); it presumably also included accounts of construction in other cities, perhaps Arbela, Aššur, Dēr, Ḫarrān, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu. The extant sections of the military narration record: (1) the sack of the Egyptian city Thebes; (2) the forcing of Baʾalu of Tyre into submission; (3) the receipt of tribute from Mannea after the coup that had brought about the death of its ruler Aḫšēri; (4) the war against Urtaku of Elam; (4) the appointment of Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) and his brother Tammarītu as king of Elam and ruler of the city Ḫidalu, respectively, following the defeat of Teumman at Tīl-Tūba; and (5) the receipt of audience gifts or (back) payments from rulers whose names and places of origin are completely broken away, from Cyrus of Parsumaš (Persia), and from Pislumê of Ḫudimiri. Although the building report is missing, it is certain from the concluding formulae that it described the rebuilding of the temple of the goddess Gula at Babylon, Esabad (“House of the Open Ear”); for descriptions of this project, see text no. 13 (Prism J) ii 13´–14´ and text no. 23 (IIT) line 53. Copies of this inscription, which is sometimes called “Prism H” in Assyriological literature, were intended for Babylon and, therefore, its script is contemporary Neo-Babylonian and it is dated in the Babylonian fashion (by regnal year). Its best preserved exemplar (ex. 1) was inscribed near the beginning of the second month (Ayyāru) of Ashurbanipal’s thirtieth regnal year (639).

Bauer (Asb. p. 28) designated exs. 1 and 2 as “Prism H₁” and “Prism H₂” respectively. Both eight-sided prisms come from Babylon and are now in the Eșki Șark Eserleri Müzesi of the Arkeoloji Müzerleri (Istanbul). The latter is presently known from excavation photo K 714 and E. Weidner’s copy (AfO 7 [1931–32] p. 3); its museum and excavation numbers are not, however, known. A third exemplar was later identified by R. Borger (AfO 19 [1959–60] p. 153) and M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (JCS 40 [1988] p. 92) in the collections of the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire (Geneva) and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (Chicago); the provenance of that piece may have been Nineveh, rather than Babylon, since the Oriental Institute fragment (A 8105) was purchased by E. Chiera from a dealer in Mosul along with numerous other prism fragments of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal. A.R. Millard (Iraq 30 [1968] pp. 106–110) suggested that a handful of fragments written in Neo-Assyrian script and found at Nineveh also bore copies of this text. However, as already noted by Borger (HKL 2 p. 200 and BIWA p. 189), those pieces are actually exemplars of a different inscription (text no. 13 [Prism J]) and, therefore, are edited there. A fourth fragment (BM 127994) was regarded as an exemplar of Prism H since its script was contemporary Neo-Babylonian; see, for example, Borger, BIWA p. 193. Following J. Novotny (Orientalia NS 74 [2005] p. 365 n. 20), BM 127994 is regarded as belonging to a hitherto unclassified inscription, one that was composed shortly after the conclusion of the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion and, therefore, is not included here, but edited as text no. 17; for further details, see the commentary of that inscription.    The master text is a conflation of the exemplars, each of which preserves the top or base of its respective prism. Ex. 1 preserves the bottom portion of cols. i–iii and viii, ex. 3 the top portion of cols. iii–vi, and ex. 2 the bottom portion of cols. v–vii. The division of the inscription into columns appears to vary between the exemplars. Although the contents of col. iv of the master text start at the beginning of col. ii´ of ex. 2, they do not directly follow the contents at the end of col. iii of the master text, which is the end of col. iv´ of ex. 1. As a result, a lacuna is placed at the beginning of col. iv. Moreover, it is unknown if the contents at the beginning of col. vi taken from the top of col. iv´ of ex. 3 directly follows those at the end of col. v, which is taken from the bottom of col. i´ of ex. 2, given that the signs in those columns cannot be deciphered. Thus, there might be an overlap or lacuna in the contents at the end of col. v and the beginning of col. vi of the master text. No score of the text is provided on Oracc.

Although there is little or no overlap between the Assyrian and Babylonian pieces, these five pieces are generally treated together as one text; it is often designated as “Prism J” in scholarly publications. Whether or not all five of these fragments are actually inscribed with the same inscription cannot be confirmed given the poor state of preservation of the pieces. Even if the prologues and military narrations were identical, it is possible that the Nineveh fragments may have recorded a different building enterprise than the one discovered at Babylon. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that the Assyrian pieces also described in their building reports the rebuilding or renovation of the  akītu -house of divine supremacy at Babylon since a few of Esarhaddon’s Babylon inscriptions were discovered at Nineveh and were written in Neo-Assyrian script. With regard to the Nineveh recension of this text, parts of the prologue and military narration are preserved. Passages record work on Ashurbanipal’s building projects at Babylon (Esagil, “House whose Top is High”; and Esabad, “House of the Open Ear”) and Borsippa (Ezida, “True House”), the submission of Baʾalu of Tyre, the payment of tribute by the Mannean ruler Uallî, and the failed attempts by the Cimmerian ruler Tugdammî (Lygdamis in classical sources) to invade Assyria are preserved. The report describing Assyria’s dealings with the Cimmerians is a little unusual since Ashurbanipal claims that their tribal leader was injured by fire that fell from the sky (a lightning bolt?), rather than being defeated in battle, and that Tugdammî died sometime later as a result of a remote magical attack; a similar account is found in text no. 23 (IIT) lines 141b–159a. As for the Babylon recension, parts of the last eleven lines of the military narration are preserved, as well as parts of the first six lines of the building report, which describes the construction of Babylon’s  akītu -house (New Year’s temple). The report of military matters ends with a statement about Ashurbanipal giving praise to his divine patrons; a similar statement appears in text no. 23 (IIT) lines 159b–161. Although none of the exemplars preserves a date, this text was written later than text no. 12 (Prism H) since it records that Ashurbanipal completed the rebuilding of the temple of Gula at Babylon (Esabad) and, therefore, it was likely written on prisms no earlier than Ashurbanipal’s thirty-first regnal year (638).

Millard (Iraq 30 [1968] pp. 106–110) classified several prism fragments that had been discovered at Nineveh (exs. 1–2 and 4) as exemplars of text no. 12 (Prism H), despite the fact that their script was Assyrian, and not contemporary Neo-Babylonian. R. Borger (HKL 2 p. 200 and BIWA p. 189) correctly reclassified them as exemplars of a different inscription (this text [“Prism J”]), and also identified several other copies of this poorly preserved text, including one found at Babylon (ex. 5). Because the extant text of the exemplars from Nineveh and Babylon do not significantly overlap one another and because the building report of the Nineveh fragments is not preserved, this inscription is provisionally regarded as having two separate recensions: J-N[ineveh] and J-B[abylon]. As already shown in Borger, BIWA p. 197, it is unclear if viii 44–45 (ex. 1) actually overlap with viii 1´–2´ (ex. 5); one expects that they should since viii 1–43 and viii 3´–11´ are similar to text no. 23 (IIT) lines 138–158a and lines 159b–161, respectively. Despite the fact that there may be two recensions of this inscription, all of the pieces associated with Borger’s “Prism J” are tentatively edited together as a single text.    The proposed non-physical join between 83-1-18,600 and BM 123425 (ex. 2) was made on the basis of the script (same hand), color, and composition of the clay, as well as the curvature of the reverse side; the surface of both fragments is extremely worn. The Nineveh copies of the text, as far as they are preserved, appear to have been inscribed on eight-sided clay prisms. Borger (BIWA p. 193) suggests ex. 1 could have originally had nine columns; note, however, that no nonagon of Ashurbanipal or of any other late Neo-Assyrian king is presently known. As pointed out by J. Novotny (Orientalia NS 74 [2005] p. 369), the height of the prism to which ex. 3 belongs appears to have been significantly taller than those of exs. 1 and 2, assuming that all three fragments are actually inscribed with one and the same text. The evidence stems from that fact that ex. 3 ii contains military narration (the campaign to Mannea), while ex. 1 ii and ex. 2 ii both contain passages describing Ashurbanipal’s building activities at Babylon and Borsippa. Moreover, ex. 2 iii preserves descriptions of the aftermath of the submission of Baʾalu of Tyre and of Iakīn-Lû of Arwad voluntarily sending tribute, military narration that always precedes reports of Ashurbanipal’s war against Aḫšēri, which is partially extant in ex. 3 ii. Alternatively, the distribution of text in ex. 3 could indicate that it is not an exemplar of this text (Prism J), but rather a copy of a hitherto unclassified prism inscription of Ashurbanipal (for example, text no. 20, assuming that it is also a separate inscription; see the commentary of that text for further information). Nevertheless, ex. 3 is tentatively regarded here as an exemplar of Prism J.    The arrangement of text, as well as the number of lines of each column, varies between the exemplars. No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in i 1–37, ii 15´–30´, vii 1´–3´, and viii 16–45; ex. 2 in ii 1´–14´ and iii 1´–13´; ex. 3 in i 38–43 and iii 1´´–9´´; ex. 4 in viii 1–15; and ex. 5 in viii 1´–17´. The division of the material into columns i–iii is based on ex. 2, while column viii is based on ex. 4. When possible, restorations are generally based on text nos. 12 (Prism H) and 23 (IIT) and, when they are not, they stem from text no. 11 (Prism A). A score of the inscription is provided on Oracc.

That conjectured non-physical join between the two fragments, however, is not accepted here since it seems unlikely that A 7920 + A 8138 and A 8130 (text no. 1 [Prism E₁] exs. 2–3), the other certain exemplars of Prism E₁, also contained a report of Ashurbanipal killing a pride of lions near Ištar’s cult center Arbela.

Only parts of the prologue and the report of the first campaign to Egypt survive. The prologue, as far as it is preserved, records that Ashurbanipal undertook work on the Aššur temple at Aššur (Eḫursaggalkurkurra, “House of the Great Mountain of the Lands”) and the temple of Marduk at Babylon (Esagil, “House whose Top is High”). Despite this inscription’s fragmentary state, it is possible to situate the composition of the text sometime between 663 and 649, possibly before 655.

Weissert and H.-U. Onasch (Orientalia NS 61 [1992] p. 73 n. 46) and J. Novotny (Orientalia NS 72 [2003] pp. 211–214), BM 128302+, 82-5-22,21, and BM 99326 are edited separately from text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂) and, therefore, regarded as belonging to a hitherto yet unclassified edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals, one composed sometime between 663 and 649. The scant evidence is as follows: (1) BM 128302+ comes from an eight-sided prism, rather than from a six- or seven-sided prism; and (2) the fifty talents of  zaḫalû -metal used to greatly enlarge the elevated dais of the god Marduk at Babylon is assumed to have originated from the Egyptian booty that was brought to Nineveh after the conquest and sack of Thebes in 664. With regard to the large amount of silver-alloy used at Babylon, Novotny, following a proposal of Onasch (ÄAT 27/1 p. 80 n. 386, and pp. 156–158 and 161), suggested that the  zaḫalû -metal came from the two metal obelisks looted from Thebes after the second Egyptian campaign and, therefore, proposed that the inscription(s) to which 82-5-22,21 and BM 128302+ belong cannot be one of the E prisms given that the  terminus ante quem  for those two texts is the sack of Thebes. For further details, see Novotny, Orientalia NS 72 (2003) pp. 211–214.    The inscription is reconstructed here as a tall octagonal prism. Based on ex. 2, it is assumed here that col. i and about half of col. ii contained the prologue of the text and that the report of the first Egyptian campaign began somewhere in the middle of col. ii. Based on the conjectured available space, the prologue of this inscription probably only contained accounts of the completion of the Aššur temple at Aššur, the decoration of the holy rooms of Esagil at Babylon, the construction of an ornate canopy, and the enlargement of Marduk’s raised dais with brick cast of  zaḫalû -metal. Because there does not seem to been enough room to include reports of the refurbishment of the pleasure bed of Marduk and Zarpanītu and the construction of a new chariot for Marduk, which were sent to Babylon in 655 and 654, this inscription may have been composed earlier than those two events.    No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in ii 1–10; ex. 2 in ii 11–21 and iii 1´–9´; and  ex. 1* in i 1´–9´. The restorations are based on text nos. 1 (Prism E₁) and 2 (Prism E₂), as well as on K 2694 + K 3050 (L 4 ; Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 77–78 no. 18), the so-called “Large Egyptian Tablets” Inscription (Novotny, SAACT 10 pp. 81–83 no. 20), BM 134557 (Novotny, SAACT 10 p. 74 no. 14), and 81-2-4,212 (Bauer, Asb. pl. 57).

Of course, one cannot rule out the possibility that the text is part of a later summary inscription composed ca. 639–638. The extant contents include reports of Ashurbanipal’s first and second Elamite campaigns; these military expeditions are treated here as a single narrative, rather than as separate accounts for the descriptions of the wars against Urtaku and his successor Teumman.     Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003715/]  of Ashurbanipal 16.    Source:  1866-05-19, 0001    Commentary    As R. Borger (BIWA p. 198) has already pointed out, 66-5-19,1 does not belong to the same object as K 13440, which is edited in Part 2 among the tablet fragments of Ashurbanipal. 66-5-19,1 is not sufficiently preserved for one to determine how many columns the prism to which this fragment belongs had.    The extant contents are similar to text no. 3 (Prism B) iv 53–79 and v 3–12 and to later inscriptions duplicating those passages. The reports of Ashurbanipal’s first and second Elamite campaigns in this inscription, as far as they are preserved, are much shorter than they are in text no. 3 (Prism B). In addition, the campaigns are not separated by a horizontal ruling; one expects a ruling between lines 16´–17´. It is unclear from the textual deviation, whether this inscription was composed shortly after the events of the battle at Tīl-Tūba in 653, as J. Novotny (Orientalia NS 72 [2003] pp. 214–215) has tentatively suggested, or whether it was written sometime after the composition of text no. 3 (Prism B), perhaps around the time of text nos. 12 (Prism H) and 13 (Prism J), ca. 639–638. Perhaps, 66-5-19,1 is an exemplar of text no. 13 (Prism J), as tentatively proposed by Borger (BIWA p. 198), or possibly of text no. 20.

The final five lines of the military narration are preserved and that section of the inscription concluded with Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), a son of a certain Atta-metu, ascending the throne of Elam after his immediate processor Indabibi was violently deposed. The inscription, which was presumably intended to be placed in Duku, may have been composed around the same time as text no. 6 (Prism C), probably in 647; it was certainly written after the end of the Šamaš-šuma-ukīn rebellion, presumably when Ashurbanipal had to make repairs to Duku. The inscription is occasionally (and wrongly) referred to as “Prism H” (see below for details).     Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003716/]  of Ashurbanipal 17.    Source:  BM 127994 (1929-10-12, 0650)    Commentary    BM 127994 was discovered at Nineveh by R. Campbell Thompson. Because its script is contemporary Babylonian, A.R. Millard (Iraq 30 [1968] p. 109) regarded the fragment as an exemplar of text no. 12 (Prism H). P. Gerardi (Assurbanipal’s Elamite Campaigns p. 114 n. 247) suggested that the fragment belonged to col. v of that summary inscription. However, this cannot be the case, as already pointed out by R. Borger (BIWA p. 193), since the main building report of text no. 12 (Prism H) would have described the rebuilding of the Gula temple Esabad (“House of the Open Ear”) at Babylon; although that passage is now missing, it would have appeared in col. viii of that inscription. Because text no. 12 (Prism H) described the restoration of a temple other than Duku, Borger proposed that BM 127994 be regarded as a different recension of Prism H. However, because the principal exemplar of text no. 12 (Prism H) was inscribed during the thirtieth regnal year of Ashurbanipal (639) and because that summary inscription included events that took place long after Ummanaldašu ascended the Elamite throne, BM 127994 cannot be regarded as a Prism H exemplar. Therefore, this fragment must come from an edition of Ashurbanipal’s annals or summary inscriptions that was written not long after the siege of Babylon ended in 648, perhaps as early as 647. Apart from its script, the text written on BM 127994, as far as it is preserved, has little in common with text no. 12 (Prism H). At this time, no new text designation had been assigned to this inscription.    Bibliography      1968 Lambert and Millard, Cat. p. 42 (study)   1968 Millard, Iraq 30 p. 109 and pl.

The prism from which this fragment originates appears to have originally had ten columns. The surfaces of both preserved columns are very badly damaged and few signs can be read with certainty.

Because part of a report of the looting of the Elamite city Susa and the return of the Babylonian goddess Nanāya to her temple in Uruk is preserved in col. ii´, it is certain that the inscription was composed sometime after the second war against Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) in 646. Because that account is shorter than those found in text nos. 9 (Prism F) and 11 (Prism A), it is assumed here that the inscription written on these two prisms was composed later than both of those inscriptions, perhaps even as late as ca. 638 (see below).

As correctly pointed out by R. Borger (BIWA p. 197), the prism was probably a decagon. For the contents of col. ii´, compare for example text no. 11 (Prism A) vi 70–74, 107–109, and 122–123. A partial score is provided on Oracc.    As for the date of composition, this is less certain. Borger (ibid.) suggests that the inscription was composed late in Ashurbanipal’s reign — presumably after text nos. 9 (Prism F; 645) and 11 (Prism A; 644, 643, or 642) — and tentatively proposes that it could be an exemplar of text no. 13 (Prism J). This suggestion is plausible, however, since the exemplars attributed to that inscription do not preserve an account of Ashurbanipal’s fifth Elamite campaign, this reasonable suggestion cannot be proven with any certainty. Therefore, it is best to edit this inscription separately.

At present, this is the only positively identified inscription of this king from Assyria written on a cylinder. The inscription provides a summary of some of Ashurbanipal’s building activities in Assyria and Babylonia and of his military conquests, most notable of which is the defeat of the Cimmerian ruler Tugdammî, which is also recorded in text nos. 13 (Prism J) and 23 (IIT).

The non-physical join between BM 122616 + BM 127966 and BM 128073 was suggested by A.R. Millard and has been provisionally accepted here. He also proposed that BM 122613, which is dated by the post-canonical eponymy of Sîn-šarru-uṣur, may have belonged to the same clay cylinder as BM 122616+. As E. Weissert ( apud  Borger, BIWA p. 356) has already pointed out, this join is unlikely since BM 122613 probably bears an inscription of Sîn-šarra-iškun.

      "text": "22     23          22    Four black stone fragments are inscribed with a late version of Ashurbanipal’s annals; the pieces either come from the same slab or belong to the same inscription that was written over a series of slabs. The fragments probably come from Nineveh and may have lined the wall of an important room of a building on the citadel (perhaps the Ištar/Mullissu temple Emašmaš). The text, as far as it is preserved, contains descriptions of Ashurbanipal’s building activities at Babylon, Borsippa, Cutha, and Nineveh, as well as his campaign against Uaiteʾ and the Arabs. The extant sections of the prologue are similar to those of text nos. 12 (Prism H), 13 (Prism J), and 23 (IIT), while the preserved parts of the military narration most closely parallel the contents of text no. 11 (Prism A). The inscription’s approximate date of composition is ca. 642–640, that is, after text no. 11 and before text no. 12.

MMA 86.11.413 (+) HMA 9-01774    Commentary    Although none of the four fragments were discovered during systematic archaeological excavations, it is likely that the pieces all originate from Nineveh (Frame in Spar and Jursa, CTMMA 4 p. 274). This proposal is supported by the fact that the goddess Ištar is specifically named in the concluding formula (ii´ 1´), that R. Campbell Thompson found numerous stone wall slab fragments that were inscribed with a lengthy summary inscription of Ashurbanipal (text no. 23 [IIT]) in the vicinity of the Emašmaš temple, and that C.F. Lehmann-Haupt purchased one of the pieces (VA 4332) in Mosul.    The script is a mixture of Assyrian and contemporary Neo-Babylonian sign forms; this is typical for seventh-century Assyrian inscriptions written on stone. The inscription, like text no. 23 (IIT), was written in several columns. HMA 9-1773 i and HMA 9-1774 ii´ are tentatively regarded as the first and last columns of the inscription. VA 4332, HMA 9-1774 i´, and MMA 86.11.413 all belong to the penultimate column. It is less certain if HMA 9-1773 ii is part of the same column as VA 4332 (+) HMA 9-1774 i´ (+) MMA 86.11.413 or part of a column that preceded it. Provisionally, HMA 9-1773 ii is regarded as belonging to a different column of the text. If this proves true, then this monumental inscription was written on at least four columns of text. However, if HMA 9-1773 ii and VA 4332 (+) HMA 9-1774 i´ (+) MMA 86.11.413 are part of one and the same column, then the inscription would have originally contained three columns. As for the placement of fragment HMA 9-1774 (+) MMA 86.11.413, it probably comes from near the bottom of the slab since HMA 9-1774 ii´ preserves part of the concluding formula.    The contents of col. i are similar to text no. 12 (Prism H) i, text no. 13 (Prism J) ii, and text no. 23 (IIT) lines 37b–38a and 50b–63. Those of col. i´ partially duplicate (with significant deviation) text no. 11 (Prism A) viii 86–106 and ix 19–56. Most of the proposed restorations come from those four inscriptions.    The proposed date of composition (ca. 642–640) is based on similarities with the contents of texts nos. 11 (Prism A) and 12 (Prism H); the latter is definitively dated by Ashurbanipal’s thirtieth regnal year (639). Because this inscription does not mention the rebuilding of the temple of Gula at Babylon, Esabad (“House of the Open Ear”), in its prologue, it is assumed here that it must have been composed before, or at the latest at the same time as, text no. 12, since inscriptions written after 639 all mention that accomplishment in their prologues; see text no. 13 (Prism J) ii 13´–14´ and text no. 23 (IIT) line 53. A date earlier than 639 may be supported by the fact that the military narration closely parallels the description of the Arab campaigns found in text no. 11 (Prism A). Given the poor state of preservation of this inscription and other extant late inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, this cannot be proven with any degree of certainty.

This poorly preserved text, of which there were at least four copies in antiquity, once lined the walls of room(s) of the temple of Nineveh’s tutelary deity. Today, this important inscription is almost entirely known through R. Campbell Thompson’s hand-drawn facsimiles, although one small piece of it has recently been discovered in the British Museum (London). The text, which is generally referred to in scholarly literature as the “Inscription from the Ištar Temple” (“IIT”), is one of the latest extant official texts of Ashurbanipal. Although the slabs were not dated, its approximate date of composition may have been around 638, about the same as text no. 13 (Prism J). Its  terminus post quem  is the rebuilding of the temple of Gula at Babylon, Esabad (“House of the Open Ear”), a project commemorated in the building report of text no. 12 (Prism H), an inscription definitively dated to Ashurbanipal’s thirtieth regnal year (639). The text opens with a long dedication to the goddess Mullissu (the Ištar of Nineveh; lines 1–26), which is followed by a detailed summary of Ashurbanipal’s many building activities in Assyria and Babylonia (lines 27–81); information is provided on construction at Aššur, Arbela, Babylon, Borsippa, Cutha, Dēr, Ḫarrān, Nineveh, and Tarbiṣu. The military narration (lines 82–161) summarizes victories on the battlefield, as well as the (voluntary) submission of distant foreign rulers, and the deaths of recalcitrant enemies and disloyal vassals; Ashurbanipal takes credit for the (untimely) fates of these enemies and explains that these men’s deaths were the rewards that the gods had given to him for being pious. One of the more important pieces of information included in this text is a report of Assyria’s skirmishes with the Cimmerian tribal leader Tugdammî, a man known as Lydgamis in classical sources (lines 146b–159a). Interestingly, this text (as well as text no. 13 [Prism J]) claims that this dangerous foe was not defeated in the heat of battle by Assyrian troops, but rather was injured by fire that fell from the sky (a lightning bolt?) and later died from some painful and deadly magical attack (beset upon him by Ashurbanipal’s magicians in Nineveh). The building report, the central point of the inscription, records the rebuilding of the Ištar/Mullissu temple Emašmaš (lines 162–166a); the famous ninth-century Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II is cited as a previous builder of that temple.

LXXXVI)     Commentary   The script is a mixture of Assyrian and contemporary Neo-Babylonian sign forms; this is typical for seventh-century Assyrian inscriptions written on stone. Each line of text is separated by a horizontal ruling. The inscription is known from approximately one hundred limestone fragments (now comprising thirty-eight exemplars) that were discovered during the 1930–31 British Museum excavations of the Kuyunjik mound under the direction of R. Campbell Thompson. The exact findspots of the pieces are neither shown on any ground plan of Nineveh nor were they recorded in Campbell Thompson’s excavation notes. However, it is stated that many of the fragments came “chiefly towards the S.E. side of the great foundation.” Despite earlier claims that this inscription was set up in triplicate, A. Fuchs (in Borger, BIWA pp. 258–259) has shown through his score (“Partitur”) transliteration that there were at least four exemplars of this double-column, monumental inscription. He tentatively estimated that each column of text may have been ca. 170 cm wide and that the total surface area of an individual exemplar may have been about 10 m 2 ; the width of the slabs would have been almost 6 m. Based on the recent identification of one of the fragments in the collection of the British Museum (BM 139999a = Thompson, AAA 20 [1933] no. 59), these estimates may need to be adjusted slightly since the copies do not accurately represent the height or width of the individual pieces; Campbell Thompson tended to elongate the vertical spacing in his copies.    As Fuchs has already noted, there are many difficulties in providing a reliable edition of the so-called IIT text. This important text is almost entirely known from Campbell Thompson’s published copies, which do not accurately represent the actual shape of the original objects and record only inscribed surfaces (damaged surfaces are not drawn or indicated). To make matters more difficult, the pieces are drawn at different scales and his composite texts are occasionally unclear in terms of what each exemplar actually contained; for example, the transition from “large main text” III to IV on Thompson, AAA 20 (1933) pls. XCIV–XCV is particularly confusing and extremely problematic. After copying and taking squeezes of the fragments, Campbell Thompson (AAA 20 [1933] p. 79 n. 1) states that the text was reburied: “Several reasons, including the fragmentary nature and the great weight of the numerous pieces, debarred both the Baghdad Museum and ourselves from moving it to a museum.” One of the smaller fragments, however, was sent back to the British Museum (BM 139999a) after being copied. Because basic information about the various pieces is unknown or uncertain (for example, size and damaged surfaces), one must exercise caution when suggesting joins between fragments. Some or many proposed joins based on Campbell Thompson’s imperfect and incomplete copies could easily be confirmed or rejected had the originals been available for first-hand study; since they are not, one can only conjecture at how the pieces actually fit together. Because Fuchs has already spent a great deal of time carefully piecing this inscription back together from Campbell Thompson’s copies and since the authors have not found any evidence contrary to Fuchs’ arrangement of the fragments, the text grouping (and their sigla) found in Borger, BIWA pp. 258–290 is followed here, with one minor change: the original of Thompson, AAA 20 (1933) no. 59 (BM 139999a) was used rather than its hand-drawn facsimile.    No exemplar is complete and the master line is a conflation of the various exemplars. When possible, preference is given to Campbell Thompson’s “large main texts” (exs. 1–4) and ex. 9 (Fuchs’ Group E). In his excellent score transliteration of the inscription, for practical reasons, Fuchs more or less followed the line count and divisions of Campbell Thompson’s edition. In a few places, he had to add a few lines and in one case delete a few others; for details, see Borger, BIWA p. 259. Despite Fuchs’ scholarly treatment, the edition here does not follow the lineation of his edition. Instead, the composite text divides the lines of the inscription differently and, as a result, the line numbering varies marginally from the editions of Fuchs and Campbell Thompson. The line count of this edition is based on the following exemplars: ex. 1 in lines 1–26; ex. 7 in lines 103–108; ex. 9 in lines 46–72, 90–102, 109–139, and 144–170; ex. 11 in lines 27–45; ex. 14 in lines 73–85; ex. 15 in lines 86–89; and ex. 17 in lines 171–183. The division of the contents of lines 140–143 is conjectural and provisionally based on ex. 9, which is badly damaged at this point. A concordance of line numbers is provided at the back of the book. A few details about the arrangement and reconstruction of this problematic text are included in the on-page notes. A score of the inscription is provided on Oracc. The few attested orthographic variants are noted at the back of the book.     Bibliography      1932 Thompson, AAA 19 p. 71 (study)   1933 Thompson, AAA 20 pp. 79–113 and pls.

      "text": "24     25     26     27     28     29        Thirty-five epigraphs of Ashurbanipal engraved on sculpted wall slabs that once lined the walls of the North Palace and South-West Palace at Nineveh are preserved. Eight (nos. 25–28 and 33–36) come from Room XXXIII of Sennacherib’s “Palace Without a Rival.” Twenty-five of the remaining twenty-seven epigraphs were presumably discovered in five rooms of Ashurbanipal’s own palace (North Palace): two in Room F (text nos. 40 and 48), three in Room I (text nos. 29–30 and 37), two (or three) in Room M (text nos. 24, 38, and possibly 49), nine (or ten) in the upper story of Room S (= S¹; text nos. 41, 44, 46, 50, 54–58, and possibly 49), two in the top floor of Room V/T (= V¹/T¹; text nos. 43 and 47), and six whose location is uncertain (text nos. 39, 42, 45, 51–53). The two remaining epigraphs (text nos. 31–32) could come from either Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace or Room I of the North Palace.    The extant epigraphs record information about the following military achievements: (1) the war against Aḫšēri of Mannea (text no. 24); (2) the defeat of the Elamite king Teumman at Tīl-Tūba (text nos. 25–32) and the installation of Ummanigaš (Ḫumban-nikaš II) on the throne of Elam (text nos. 33–34); (3) the flaying of two high profile Gambulian rebels (text no. 36); (4) the capture of Babylon after the death of Ashurbanipal’s brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn (text no. 38); (4) the defeat of Ummanigaš (probably text no. 39); (5) the capture and looting of Elamite cities during Ashurbanipal’s wars with the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) in 647 and 646 (text nos. 40–48); (6) the capture of Ummanaldašu (text no. 49); and (7) the looting of the city Bīt-Luppi (text no. 51). In addition, one epigraph (text no. 35) records that Ashurbanipal made Elamite envoys stand before messengers of the Urarṭian king Rusâ and hold writing boards with insulting messages, while another epigraph (text no. 50) records that the Assyrian king made several captured Elamite kings (Ummanaldašu [Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III], Tammaritu, and Paʾe) serve him a meal at a banquet.    A label (text no. 37) on a relief identifies the depicted city as the city Arbela, one of the goddess Ištar’s principal cult centers. Presumably that city’s depiction was part of a scene showing a triumphal procession of Ashurbanipal, during which defeated Gambulian leaders (including Dunānu and his brother Samgunu) were paraded through the streets of Arbela with the decapitated heads of the Elamite king Teumman and his entourage hung around their necks.    Lastly, five epigraphs (text nos. 54–58) record two successful lion hunts, one that took place out in the open steppe (text no. 54) and one that was staged on the outskirts of Nineveh (text nos. 55–58); during the latter, Ashurbanipal appears to have symbolically killed eighteen lions, one for each city gate of Nineveh.         24    A partially preserved two-line epigraph is engraved on a sculpted slab that once decorated a wall of the Throne Room of the North Palace (Room M). The inscription, which is known only from E. Norris’ published copy (1 R pl. 8 no. 1), records the conquest and plundering of Birat-Adad-rēmanni, an important fort situated on the Assyrian-Mannean border; the event took place during Ashurbanipal’s war against Aḫšēri of Mannea (between 663 and 649).    Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003723/]  of Ashurbanipal 24.    Source:  1 R pl. 8 no. 1    Commentary    According to the note accompanying the copy of the inscription in 1 R (pl. 8 no. 1), the epigraph was written on a slab adjoining the one bearing text no. 38, BM 124946 (Room M, slab 13), which depicts Ashurbanipal reviewing booty and prisoners after his troops had captured Babylon (648). The stated location is highly implausible since it is doubtful that the sole, small corner slab 14 would have been devoted to depicting a scene from Ashurbanipal’s Mannean campaign or that slabs 10–11 would have contained a relief depicting an event other than the aftermath of the capture of Babylon. Furthermore, only the base of slab 14 is said to have remained and slabs 10–11 were ruined (according to W. Boutcher’s second plan; these slabs are marked as more or less intact in his original plan). This leaves the poorly preserved slabs 2–7 as potential locations for this now-lost epigraph; slabs 8–9 were unsculpted. A piece from that series of slabs (AO 19912 and AO 19921; Or. Dr. 7 no. 32) shows Assyrian cavalry men and archers in difficult mountain terrain, near a river, presumably assaulting a city (on the now-lost slab 6). Since Birat-Adad-rēmanni was located in mountainous terrain, in the border region between Assyria and Mannea, this epigraph may have accompanied the image of the besieged city that was depicted on slabs 6–7 of Room M. As K. Radner (personal communication) has pointed out, the depiction of the rugged terrain seems to match that of the region around modern Penjwin near the Iranian border. R.D. Barnett (Sculptures from the North Palace p. 46), however, suggests that the besieged city may have been the Elamite city Murūbisi, which is mentioned in an epigraph inscribed on BM 124793 (text no. 49), a slab discovered by H. Rassam in 1886; although that fragment is generally assigned to this room, there is no documented proof of BM 124793 being found in Ashurbanipal’s throne room. Barnett’s proposed identification stems from (1) the fact that the Elamite king Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III) is being escorted to a chariot in mountainous terrain on BM 124793 and (2) the assumption that the unidentified Elamite king on BM 124945–6 (Room M, slabs 12–13) is that same captive Elamite king. With regard to the latter point, it is now generally assumed that the Elamite depicted on BM 124945–6 is Tammarītu; see, for example, Novotny and Watanabe, Iraq 70 (2008) p. 119.    R. Borger (BIWA pp. 298 and 385), presumably accepting the findspot notation in 1 R as accurate, suggests that the piece on which this epigraph was inscribed sank to the bottom of the Tigris River in May 1855. According to Boutcher, slabs 2–3, 7, 10–11, 15–16, and 18–20 of Room M were to have been sent to the Louvre, and, therefore, Borger, without explicitly stating it, seems to suggest that the epigraph in question would have appeared on slabs 10–11, which is unlikely because those two slabs would not have depicted a scene of a siege in rugged mountain terrain, as already noted by Barnett (Sculptures from the North Palace p. 46). Moreover, the piece bearing the Birat-Adad-rēmanni epigraph need not be at the bottom of the Tigris. The evidence is two-fold: (1) Slab 7, or at least part of it (compare AO 19912 and AO 19921 to Or. Dr. 7 no. 32), made it to Paris; and (2) slabs 4–6 were very poorly preserved and not sent to the Louvre (according to Boutcher). Given the meager available evidence, it seems plausible that this damaged two-line epigraph was inscribed on a fragment from slab 6 (or slab 5) of Room M. How the piece became associated with slabs 12–13 (BM 124945–6) of Ashurbanipal’s throne room, however, remains unclear. If the piece had been sent back to London with the Babylon booty scene — which could explain the notation in 1 R — one would expect the inscribed fragment to have already been discovered in the British Museum’s collections.    As for Birat-Adad-rēmanni, this settlement may have been one of the towns and forts that Ashurbanipal claims to have conquered and destroyed in his campaign to Mannea. According to several annalistic texts, a number of cities near Paddiri that had once belonged to Assyria and been annexed by Mannea returned to Assyria after the defeat of Aḫšēri. See, for example, text no. 3 (Prism B) iii 52b–61. Since the names and number of settlements captured and destroyed in that region are not recorded in Ashurbanipal’s prism inscriptions, it is possible that Birat-Adad-rēmanni may have been one of them.    Contrary to the copy in 1 R (pl. 8 no. 1) and Borger’s transliteration (BIWA p. 298), there may be more damage at the end of both lines than suggested. See the on-page note to lines 1 and 2 for details.

Rassam reports that he discovered two slabs in Room I of the North Palace that had inscriptions, including an epigraph with three long lines (ca. 61 cm in length) that was written above a tent; he notes that that text was not as well preserved as the four-line epigraph (text no. 29) that was engraved on slab 1. Because Rassam seems not to have copied, transliterated, or translated the inscription, the contents of this text are no longer known. Because the reliefs in Room I, like Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace, were concerned with the defeat of the Elamite king Teumman at Tīl-Tūba and that of the Gambulian ruler Dunānu at Ša-pī-Bēl, presumably this epigraph provided information about the immediate aftermath of the Assyrian-Elamite battle near the Ulāyu River in 653.

This five-line epigraph — which is engraved on one of the sculpted wall slabs that decorated Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace (slab 5, lower register) and which appears above an Elamite being led by the hand by an Assyrian officer — records the celebratory entry of Ummanigaš into the cities Madaktu and Susa in the year 653.

Rassam in 1886 and the general scholarly consensus is that this slab once lined one of the walls of Ashurbanipal’s throne room in the North Palace (Room M), despite the absence of documented proof. See, for example, Barnett, Sculptures from the North Palace p. 46 (slab 1, 2, 3, or 5?); Gerardi, JCS 40 (1988) p. 23 (slab 2?); and J.M. Russell, Writing on the Wall p. 205 (slab 2?). The association of the fragment with Room M stems from R.D. Barnett’s assumptions that the mountainous terrain depicted on slab 7 is the same as that shown on BM 124793 and that the Elamite king depicted on BM 124945–6 (Room M, slabs 12–13) is Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), who without question is depicted on BM 124793. His assumptions, however, may not be correct in either instance since the Elamite depicted on BM 124945–6 is probably Tammarītu (Novotny and Watanabe, Iraq 70 [2008] p. 119) and because the mountainous scene engraved on slab 7 (and the now-missing slab 6) most likely shows the siege of the city Birat-Adad-rēmanni, a fort on the Assyrian-Mannean border (see the commentary to text no. 24). Should this fragment actually belong to Room M, then it may have been part of slab 2 (or even slab 3) since those slabs were more or less intact when discovered (according to W. Boutcher’s original plan); slab 5 is highly unlikely as it probably depicted the attack on Birat-Adad-rēmanni. The tentative, yet plausible, association of BM 124793 with slab 2, as P. Gerardi and J.M. Russell suggest, is not entirely unproblematic as that piece was to have been sent to the Louvre (Paris) along with Room M slabs 3, 7, 10–11, 15–16, and 18–20. Because the piece is now in the British Museum (London), one may question the degree of certainty for the proposed original position of the relief fragment. If BM 124793 does not come from Room M, then where might it have originated? One possibility is Room S¹. This tentative suggestion is based solely on the fact that Ummanaldašu almost certainly appears on BM 124794 (see text no. 50) together with at least one other deposed Elamite king (Tammarītu or Paʾê). Of course, depictions of the captured Ummanaldašu need not be confined to a single room. Until further, more concrete evidence becomes available, the exact provenance of this inscribed and sculpted fragment will remain uncertain.

Source:  Loftus, Notebook B    Commentary   The use of the Š stem of the verb  nakāru  (“become different”) is not common in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal. For example, in this volume, it appears four other times: text no. 7 (Prism Kh) vii 42, text no. 11 (Prism A) iii 105 and vii 102, and text no. 23 (IIT) line 109. This sense of the verb (“cause hostility between”) is used in connection with Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, who incited the people of Akkad, Chaldea, and Aram to side with him, and with Uaiteʾ (an Arabian king), who encouraged Arab tribes to rebel. Given the lack of relevant information, it is not possible to determine which enemy of Assyria’s defeat is recorded here.    The framing of the copy of W.K. Loftus seems to indicate that hardly anything is missing from the ends of the lines, and nothing at the end of line 1. Following R.D. Barnett, the edition here assumes that the epigraph was written over the surface of two slabs and that more text to the right of what was copied is now missing.

R. Campbell Thompson reports that he found more than eighty complete exemplars, as well as countless fragmentary exemplars. The king also boasts that he had former Elamite kings (Ummanigaš, Tammarītu, Paʾê, and Ummanaldašu) hitched to his processional carriage; in text nos. 11 (Prism A) and 23 (IIT), these kings, along with a captured Arabian leader, pulled Ashurbanipal up to the main gate of Emašmaš, the temple of Ištar/Mullissu, during an  akītu -festival. The slabs are not dated. However, the  terminus post quem  for the text’s composition is the capture of Ummanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), which took place between the composition of text nos. 9 (Prism F; 645) and 11 (Prism A; 644, 643, or 642).

Smith utilized three exemplars in his 1887 edition of this inscription; these are Nineveh Gallery nos. 61 and 66–67. According to the British Museum Collection online, BM 124814 (ex. 5) is Nineveh Gallery no. 67. As for Nineveh Gallery nos. 61 and 66, M. Streck (Asb. p. XLVII) suggested that BM 22467 (ex. 1) may have been one of those two pieces. This identification, however, seems unlikely since other pieces in that gallery bear BM numbers starting with 1248; for example, BM 124812 = text no. 60 ex. 4. Thus, BM 124811 (ex. 4), BM 124817 (ex. 6), and BM 124819 (ex. 7) are the most likely candidates. Since BM 124811 (ex. 4) was the one used by A.H. Layard for his Neo-Assyrian typeset copy in his ICC, R. Borger (BIWA pp. 353–354) proposes that that slab was one of the pieces displayed in the former Nineveh Gallery. The present whereabouts of the exemplar published by Botta (ex. 14) is not known; Streck suggested that it might be in Paris. Ex. 16 (Thompson, Arch. 79 pl. XLIII no. 44 variants) actually comprises numerous slabs. The exact number is unknown, but R. Campbell Thompson mentions that he discovered approximately eighty complete limestone slabs; from the fragmentary and complete exemplars, Campbell Thompson calculated that there could have been as many as four hundred slabs paving the courtyard of Ezida. Many of these are now in the Mosul Museum (A. al-Juboori [personal communication]). An additional four slabs are reported to have been discovered by Iraqi archaeologists in the early 1990s in a secondary context; see Ahmad, Sumer 49 (1997–98) pp. 104–106.    In all instances, the inscribed surfaces were laid face down, with their uninscribed surfaces exposed. The distribution of the inscription varies from slab to slab. In many exemplars, the text is written in eighteen lines (exs. 1–9, 13–14, and 20–21), while in a few others it is inscribed in seventeen (ex. 19) or nineteen lines (exs. 15 and 18). Furthermore, exs. 1, 3, 5–9, 14, and 18–19 have a horizontal ruling between each line of text, including a horizontal ruling before the first line and after the last line of the inscription, while exs. 2, 4, and 15 have no horizontal rulings. The master text is based on ex. 1 with help from the other exemplars, though the lineation of lines 12 and 13 is based on exs. 2–4, 8–9, 13, and 20–21, which have EN- ía  at the beginning of line 13 rather than at the end of line 12. A score of the text is presented on Oracc and the minor (orthographic) variants are listed at the back of the book. Exs. 10–12 and 16–17 are not included in the score since these unpublished slabs were not available for study; however, the known variants in exs. 11–12 and 16 are noted both in the score and with the minor variants.

These paving stones, however, record the enlargement of the courtyard of Emašmaš. Just like the previous inscription, this text also mentions that Ashurbanipal used deposed Elamite kings in lieu of horses to pull his processional carriage. Although the slabs do not bear a date, their  terminus post quem  can be established: The latest dateable event is the capture of the Elamite king Ummmanaldašu (Ḫumban-ḫaltaš III), which took place some time between 645 and ca. 642. This inscription is generally referred to as the “Mullissu Inscription” in scholarly publications.

Smith utilized four exemplars in his 1887 edition of this inscription; these are Nineveh Gallery nos. 62–65. Smith’s main text was no. 64. According to the British Museum Collection online, BM 124812 (ex. 4) is no. 62, BM 124813 (ex. 5) is no. 63, and BM 124815 (ex. 6) is no. 64. Presumably, BM 124816 (ex. 7) is no. 65. VA 8997, according to C.F. Lehmann-Haupt, originates from Nimrud (Kalḫu) and is dedicated to Ninurta. Only the upper-left hand corner of the slab is preserved. The DN in line 1 is only partially preserved ( d NI[N. x  ...]). Is this fragmentary slab a duplicate of the Mullissu inscription or is it a similar text dedicated to Ninurta at Kalḫu by Assurbanipal? The former seems more likely.    In all instances, the inscribed surfaces were laid face down, with their uninscribed surfaces exposed. The distribution of the inscription varies from slab to slab. In most exemplars, the text is written in eighteen lines (exs. 1–2, 6, 11, and 13–14) or nineteen lines (exs. 3, 7–8, 10, and 12), while in one case each it is inscribed in seventeen lines (ex. 5) and twenty lines (ex. 4). Furthermore, exs. 1–9 and 13–14 have a horizontal ruling between each line of text, including a horizontal ruling before the first line and after the last line of the inscription, while ex. 11 has no horizontal rulings. The master text is based on ex. 1. A score of the text is presented on Oracc and the minor (orthographic) variants are listed at the back of the book.

In the repertoire of Assyrian hieroglyphs (Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 238–243 no. 115), the lion represents the king; see that text for further details and bibliography. The master text is a composite of exs. 1–9, with help from the uncertain exemplars. A score is presented on Oracc.     Because none of the inscriptions are fully intact, it is impossible to know with certainty if the text included only Esarhaddon or both Esarhaddon and Sennacherib in the king’s genealogy; see the comments of Fr.W. von Bissing (ZA 46 [1940] p. 161 no. 9 n. 2), and I. Finkel (in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 22). At present, it cannot be ruled out that this inscription ended in one of the following ways: (1) A  m AN.ŠÁR-PAP-AŠ MAN ŠÚ MAN KUR AN.ŠÁR.KI “son of Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria”; (2) A  m AN.ŠÁR-PAP-AŠ MAN ŠÚ MAN KUR AN.ŠÁR.KI A  md 30-PAP-MEŠ-SU MAN ŠÚ MAN KUR AN.ŠÁR.KI “son of Esarhaddon, king of the world, king of Assyria, son of Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria.” Tentatively following von Bissing, the former is preferred here.    Based on exs. 17*–19*, assuming they bear copies of this inscription and not of some other text, one expects the text to end with  šar māt aššur  (“king of Assyria”), and not  šar māt aššurma  (with enclitic  -ma ) and, therefore, Sm 2220 is tentatively edited with text no. 69. The objects 81-7-27,180 and Sm 2380 are excluded here because it seems more likely that they should be attributed to Esarhaddon, and not Ashurbanipal; see Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 24 no. 74 and p. 26 no. 91. 82-5-22,603A, BM 118779 (K 8551, 82-5-22,607A), Ki 1902-5-10,25, Sm 2243, Sm 2220, and 55-12-5,11 are also not included since those pieces may have been inscribed with a text of Sîn-šarra-iškun (or Aššur-etel-ilāni); see Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 23 nos. 62 and 64, p. 25 no. 82, p. 26 no. 89, and p. 56 nos. 389 and 391. It is possible that the following other stone vessel fragments could be exemplars of this inscription or text nos. 69–70: Sm 2378, 55-12-5,20, 55-12-5,477, BM 139629, 1994-11-5,340, DT 502, Bu 91-5-9,248, 55-12-5,13 + 81-7-27,178, and 55-12-5,6.

Although the attribution is not certain (see the commentary), the text is included here arbitrarily as a certain text of Ashurbanipal following the suggestion of I. Finkel and J.E. Reade (in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 53). Three other small vessel fragments may be inscribed with this same inscription; they are, however, too fragmentary to be certain if they duplicate this text or contain some other late Neo-Assyrian inscription.

The enclitic  -ma  after  šar mat aššur  (“king of Assyria”) and the use of a single title for Sennacherib probably suggest that the inscription should be attributed to Ashurbanipal, rather than some other late Neo-Assyrian king. Note, however, that the writing of Assyria as KUR AŠ is not yet attested in the certain Ashurbanipal vessel fragments (see text no. 68). At present, an attribution to Ashurbanipal seems more likely than one to Esarhaddon and, therefore the inscription written on BM 135453 should be tentatively assigned to the former. It is possible that Sm 2243, 55-12-5,11, and Sm 2220 (exs. 1*–3*) are duplicates of this text or text no. 70, or of some other seventh-century Assyrian inscription (possibly belonging to Aššur-etel-ilāni or Sîn-šarra-iškun).

Source:  BM 118766 (1881-02-04, 0026)    Commentary   Based on Esarhaddon’s titles ( {šar kiššati šar māt aššur  “king of the world, king of Assyria”), an attribution to Ashurbanipal is fairly certain. If this text had belonged to Esarhaddon, one would have expected a few more titles; compare Leichty, RINAP 4 pp. 71–72 no. 25, pp. 73–74 nos. 28–29, and p. 173 no. 91. An attribution to Sîn-šarra-iškun, an Assyrian ruler who includes four generations in his genealogy, is unlikely as one would expect Esarhaddon to be referred to only as  šar māt aššur  (“king of Assyria”). Thus, as already proposed by I. Finkel and J.E. Reade (in Searight, Assyrian Stone Vessels p. 58), BM 118766 probably bears an inscription of Ashurbanipal.

Tablet 001     Tablet 002      Tablet 003     Tablet 004           Tablet 001    A nearly complete single-column tablet bears one of the earliest inscriptions of Ashurbanipal. This text is perhaps one of the most unusual of the known official texts of Assyria’s last great king since it does not contain the king’s name, titulary, and genealogy and because its contents are similar in style to two well-known literary texts,  Ludlul Bē Nēmeqi  and “The Assyrian Elegy.” This unique text begins with a brief summary of Ashurbanipal’s accomplishments and ends with a petition to an unnamed god, in which he complains about how he suffers day and night, as if he was “someone who does not revere god or goddess.” As for his good deeds, Ashurbanipal claims to have lavishly decorated the temple of the goddess Ištar at Arbela (Egašankalama, “House of the Lady of the Land”); built the inner and outer walls of Arbela; renovated the  akītu -house (“New Year’s temple”) of Ištar, which was located in the city Milqīʾa (a town near Arbela); and set up divine emblems in the temple of god Nergal at Tarbiṣu (Egalmeslam, “Palace, Warrior of the Netherworld”). In addition, Ashurbanipal records that he installed his older brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn as king of Babylon and consecrated his younger brothers Aššur-mukīn-palēʾa and Aššur­etel-šamê-erṣetim-muballissu as  šešgallu -priests of the principal temples of the cities Aššur and Ḫarrān respectively. Although the tablet is not dated, it is certain from the historical references that the inscription was composed very early in Ashurbanipal’s reign, possibly during his first regnal year (668 BC); in any event, the  terminus post quem  is Ayyāru (II) 668. Scholars sometimes refer to this text as “L[ondon]³ Inscription.”      Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003769/]  of Ashurbanipal Tablet 001.

There is little doubt that this tablet copy served as a draft for a better executed, polished inscription since there are numerous erasures and scribal notes. This important text provides detailed information about Ashurbanipal’s education as heir designate of Assyria and the elaborate and festive return of Marduk and his entourage to his newly-rebuilt temple, which coincided with the installation of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn on the throne of Babylon; Esarhaddon had personally planned to do both of these things, but he died before these plans could come to fruition and, therefore, these important duties fell to Ashurbanipal. As for his education, the Assyrian king boasts in this inscription that he had learnt all there was to know about the various scribal disciplines, including the ability to recognize and discuss celestial and terrestrial portents, to solve complex mathematical calculations, and to read old and obscure Sumerian and Akkadian texts. In addition, Ashurbanipal claims to have been trained in all forms of combat, including how ride a horse, steer a chariot, and hold various weapons and shields. As part of his practical training, he actively participated in the day-to-day activities of the royal court. Shortly after becoming king, in his first regnal year (668 BC), the text records that the new ruler fulfilled two major desires of his father: (1) Returning the god Marduk to his rightful and (2) making his older brother the king of Babylon. The inscription details the ceremonial procession from Baltil (Aššur) to Šuanna (Babylon). The building account records the fashioning of a stele, on which a copy of this text was to be engraved. Although the tablet is not dated, as one excepts from drafts, the  terminus post quem  for this text, which is known in scholarly literature as “Ashurbanipal’s School Days Inscription” or the “L[ondon]⁴ Inscription,” is Ayyāru (II) 668 BC, the month and year when Ashurbanipal accompanied Marduk and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn to Babylon. It is not certain, however, whether it was composed before or after the event.     Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003770/]  of Ashurbanipal Tablet 002.    Source:  K 02694 + K 03050    Commentary   Approximately seventy-five percent of the original text is preserved; cols. i, ii, and iii probably contained ca. 45– 50 lines each. Based on a physical examination of the tablet, there are about eight lines missing from the beginning of col. i, possibly one line missing from the bottom of col. i, about four to six lines missing from the bottom of col. ii, and four lines missing from the top of col. iii; there may be no lines missing from the beginning of col. iv.     As stated in the introduction, the text written on K 2694+ is clearly a draft, which is abundantly clear from the high number of erasures (including several complete lines) and scribal notes. As for the scribal notes, these appear in the blank space between cols. iii and iv, and in col. iv, after the last line of the inscription (iv 5´). The notes in col. iv are written in a very small script and are grouped in two sections: (1) iv 6´–7´, which are 2.2 cm below iv 5´, and (2) iv 8´–20´, which were written 1.6 cm below the first set of scribal notes. The notations pertain to the text of col. iii and, as S. Parpola ( apud  Novotny, SAACT 10 p. xvii and pp. 79–80) suggests, the text of these lines likely represent labels to a set of bas-reliefs illustrating the events described in the inscription; for example, compare the epigraphs accompanying the reliefs illustrating Assurbanipal’s victory at Tīl-Tūba in 653 BC, which are found in Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace and Room I of the North Palace; see text nos. 23–32. Col. iv 6´– 7´ plausibly pertain to iii l´, since that line begins with  ia-a-ti  (“me”), and iv 14´–18´ to iii 2´–7´.     Bibliography      1871 G.

This text, which scholarly literature generally refers to as the “Large Egyptian Tablets” (LET) or “Ḫarrān Tablets” (HT), records information about two Egyptian campaigns (including the sack and looking of Thebes), the conquest of the city Qirbit, and the voluntary submission of Gyges of Lydia, Mugallu of Tabal, and Iakīn-Lû of Arwad. It also provides some information about Ashurbanipal’s extensive work on the temple of the moon-god at Ḫarrān, including the lavish decoration of its principal cult rooms; some of the metal used may have come from Theban booty. It is clear from the subscript of one exemplar (ex. 3) that copies of this inscription were intended to be deposited or displayed in the newly-constructed Eḫulḫul. As is typical for inscriptions written on clay tablets, no date line is given. Because the death of Egyptian pharaoh Taharka, the sack of Thebes, and the submission of Mugallu are all recorded, it is certain that text of the so-called “Large Egyptian Tablets” was composed after text nos. 1–2 (the E-Prisms). The latest dateable historical events are probably Mugallu and Iakīn-Lû sending payment to Nineveh, which took place either after the sack of Thebes (664 BC) or the conquest of Tyre (ca. 662 BC) and, therefore, the text was probably written ca. 663–661 BC.

The Assyrian king claims to have sounded defeated the lions and thoroughly scattered them, allowing the terrorized neighboring inhabitants and their livestock to live without fear. Moreover, Ashurbanipal records that some of wild beasts were captured alive; presumably, some of these lions were taken back to Nineveh, where they were later killed during a controlled, ritual hunt held at the Assyrian capital. Based on historical references appearing in the text, this hunt took place sometime after the Elamite king Urtaku had died and many of his relatives had fled to Assyria to avoid being killed on the orders of the newly-enthroned Teumman. Some of these political refugees, including Urtaku’s own son Ummanappa, participated in the hunt, as well as demonstrated their archery skills to Ashurbanipal. This event was also visually represented on at least one of the walls of Ashurbanipal’s palace (North Palace, Room S¹). Although the  terminus post quem  for the text’s composition is the death of Urtaku (664 BC), scholars generally think that the inscription was written a few years later, around 660 BC. This inscription is often referred to as the “Large Hunting Inscription” (“grosse Jagdinschrift”).

A large number of Ashurbanipal’s royal inscriptions come from or mention Babylonia and these texts record that this Assyrian king carried out work at Babylon on the city wall (Babylonian Inscription 1), Ekarzagina, the shrine of the god Ea (Babylonian Inscription 6 and likely Babylonian Inscription 2), Eturkalama, the temple of the goddess Ištar of Babylon (Babylonian Inscription 3), Emaḫ, the temple of the goddess Ninmaḫ (Babylonian Inscription 4), Esagil, the temple of the god Marduk (Babylonian Inscriptions 5 and 7), and Etemenanki, the ziggurat (Babylonian Inscriptions 7–11). At Sippar he restored Ebabbar, the temple of the god Šamaš (Babylonian Inscription 14) and at Borsippa he did work on the city wall (Babylonian Inscription 12) and on Ezida, the temple of the god Nabû (Babylonian Inscription 13). Work was carried out at Nippur on the ziggurat (Babylonian Inscriptions 16 and 18), Ekur, the temple of the god Enlil (Babylonian Inscription 17), and another structure (Babylonian Inscription 19). Eanna, the temple of the goddess Ištar at Uruk, was also restored (Babylonian Inscription 15). A cylinder fragment mentioning the goddess Ištar of Akkad and the temple of the goddess Ištar can probably be assigned to Ashurbanipal (Babylonian Inscription 20); it likely describes work on the temple of the goddess Ištar of Akkad either at the city of Akkad or at Babylon. A brick found in the ziggurat at Dūr-Kurigalzu and several from Ešaḫula, the temple of the god Nergal at Sirara (Mê-Turran), attest to work at these two sites (Babylonian Inscriptions 21 and 22 respectively). A poorly preserved copy of a further dedicatory inscription of Ashurbanipal is also attested (Babylonian Inscription 23).    Exactly when in his reign the various building programs carried out in his name took place is unknown. The following inscriptions, however, mention his brother Šamaš-šuma-ukīn in a friendly manner and thus must date before the beginning of the latter’s rebellion in 652 BC: Babylonian Inscription 1 (city wall of Babylon), Babylonian Inscription 6 (Ekarzagina), Babylonian Inscription 2 (probably a structure at Babylon associated with the god Ea), Babylonian Inscription 3 (Eturkalama), Babylonian Inscription 4 (Emaḫ), Babylonian Inscription 5 (Esagil), Babylonian Inscription 14 (Ebabbar), Babylonian Inscription 12 (city wall of Borsippa), Babylonian Inscription 13 (Ezida), and Babylonian Inscription 15 (Eanna). Babylonian Inscriptions 9 and 17–19 are written in Sumerian; the remainder are written in Akkadian. Two of the inscriptions are on stone steles (Babylonian Inscriptions 6 and 13), ten upon clay cylinders (Babylonian Inscriptions 1, 2–5, 12, 14–16, and 20), ten upon bricks (Babylonian Inscriptions 7–11, 17–19, and 21–22), and one upon a clay tablet (Babylonian Inscription 23).

Sîn-balāssu-iqbi, a governor of Ur for at least part of the time Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šuma-ukīn were on the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia respectively, has left several inscriptions which record the construction or restoration of various structures at that city (Babylon Inscriptions 2001–2016). None of these mention Šamaš-šuma-ukīn, but three refer to Ashurbanipal (Babylon Inscriptions 2003–2004 and 2015). Thus the inscriptions of this important Babylonian governor have been placed with those of Ashurbanipal instead of Šamaš-šuma-ukīn. Sîn-balāssu-iqbi was preceded in office by his father Ningal-iddin, who held that position in the time of Esarhaddon and undoubtedly already in the time of Sennacherib. Two Babylonian economic texts composed in 658 and 657 BC refer to Sîn-balāssu-iqbi as governor, but he may have already taken office in the reign of Esarhaddon. He was succeeded by two of his brothers, Sîn-šarra-uṣur and Sîn-tabni-uṣur, the latter of whom is known to have held office in at least 650 and 649 BC.

It is the first of nine similar inscriptions from Ur which deal with shrines at that city (B.6.32.2005–2013). Two of these inscriptions mention only the god Nanna (B.6.32.2011-2012) and one assigns a shrine to the god Enlil (B.6.32.2013). The remaining six inscriptions for the most part ascribe shrines to relatively minor deities: Ninkasi, Šuzianna, Kusu, Nusku, Ninimma, and Ennugi (Babylonian Inscriptions 2005–2010). Each of these six deities was one of the “sons of Enmešarra,” a god who was connected with the netherworld and viewed as an ancestor of Enlil (see Gadd, UET 1 p. 56, and Hibbert, OrAnt 21 [1982] pp. 256–57). Each is also known to have had a shrine at Enlil’s city of Nippur (see Bernhardt and Kramer, Orientalia NS 44 [1975] p. 98, and George, House Most High pp. 12–13). All except Ninkasi are known to have been specifically associated with the god Enlil in some way (see An =  Anum  i 184, 252, 306, 318, and 324). It thus appears that in carrying out his renovations at Ur, Sîn-balāssu-iqbi was modelling his work upon the situation at Nippur. Since several of his inscriptions refer to Nanna/Sîn as “king of the Enlil (circle of) gods” (B.6.32.2001–2002 and 2005–2013) and since one refers to Nanna’s Enlilship (nam- d en-líl-lá-a-ni, Babylonian Inscription 2012 line 7), it seems that Sîn-balāssu-iqbi was attempting to promote a syncretism between Nanna (Sîn) and Enlil.

Because work on  Part 2  (Ashurbanipal texts 72-2018, Aššur-etel-ilāni texts 1-6, and Sîn-šarra-iškun 1-21) is still very much a work in progress, we kindly ask you to be patient with us and to bear in mind that the information included under the RINAP 5/2 tab is far from complete and is subject to change.

Relatively few inscriptions are known for Sîn-šarra-iškun, the last Assyrian king to have ruled from Nineveh. Scholars have identified about twenty official texts of his, although several of these could have been composed in the name of his much more powerful father, Ashurbanipal. At present, Sîn-šarra-iškun’s texts come from cities in the Assyrian heartland, Nineveh (text nos. 1–6), Aššur (text nos. 7–18), and Kalḫu (text nos. 19–20). The extant inscriptions are all written in the Akkadian language and are inscribed on clay cylinders (text nos. 1–5, 10, and 19), clay prisms (text nos. 7–9), clay tablets (text nos. 6 and 15–18), a clay bulla (text no. 19), mud bricks (text nos. 13–14), and a stone block (text no. 12). It is clear from scribal notes written on drafts or archival copies of inscriptions that official texts were also engraved on the metal plating of ceremonial tables (text nos. 17–18) and on metal cultic vessels and utensils (text nos. 15–16).     The texts record some of this king’s building activities. Sîn-šarra-iškun is known to have sponsored construction on the Sennacherib’s “Palace Without a Rival” (South-West Palace; text no. 1); the city wall of Nineveh (text no. 6); the temple of the god Nabû at Aššur, Egidrukalamasumu (“House Which Bestows the Scepter of the Land”; text nos. 7–18); and the Nabû temple at Kalḫu, Ezida (“True House”; text no. 19). Presumably, he undertook other building projects, but inscriptions (text nos. 2–5) recording those activities are either not sufficiently preserved (text nos. 2–5) or no longer extant.     Because work on  Part 2  (Ashurbanipal texts 72-2018, Aššur-etel-ilāni texts 1-6, and Sîn-šarra-iškun 1-21) is still very much a work in progress, we kindly ask you to be patient with us and to bear in mind that the information included under the RINAP 5/2 tab is far from complete and is subject to change.

King, appear to have the same inscription of Sîn-šarra-iškun written on them. That text, at least according to one exemplar, records the renovation of the western entrance of the “Palace Without a Rival” (South-West Palace) at Nineveh; Sîn-šarra-iškun calls his great grandfather’s royal residence the “Alabaster House,” which undoubtedly refers to its numerous sculpted and inscribed limestone slabs and colossal apotropaic figures. In addition to boasting that he rebuilt that part of the palace from its foundations to its crenellations, Sîn-šarra-iškun claims to have expanded the building’s structure beyond what it had been in the reign of Sennacherib. One copy of this text, which is generally referred to in scholarly publications as “Cylinder C,” was inscribed the eponymy of Nabû-tappûtī-alik, the chief eunuch (613*).

The inscription records that the temple had been so neglected in the past that Nabû and his consort Tašmētu were forced to live in the (neighboring) temple of the Assyrian Ištar, where they scraped by on meagre portions of leftover offerings. In typical Assyrian style, Sîn-šarra-iškun claims that he built Egidrukalamasumu (“House Which Bestows the Scepter of the Land”) from top to bottom. Afterwards, the king reports that he had Nabû and Tašmētu ushered into their newly-constructed home and fêted with an overabundance of food offerings.

This inscription fills in several gaps in the prism version of the text, including some details about the alleged building history of Egidrukalamasumu (“House Which Bestows the Scepter of the Land”). According to this text, which is also commonly referred to as “Cylinder A” in scholarly publications, Sîn-šarra-iškun had Nabû’s temple rebuilt from top to bottom on the foundations of an earlier building, one that had been worked on by the Middle Assyrian kings Shalmaneser I and Aššur-rēša-iši I and the Neo-Assyrian ruler Adad-nārārī III. This statement, however, is contradicted in text no. 12, which states that Egidrukalamasumu was constructed anew on a vacant plot of land. Since the archaeological record supports what is stated in text no. 12, one should disregard the building history included in “Cylinder A.” It appears that when the building report of this text was drafted, its composer(s) may have believed that there had been an earlier Nabû temple built at Aššur and (partly) conflated its building history with that of the adjacent (and underlying) incarnations of the Ištar temple; early twentieth-century German excavations have revealed that the foundations of the western part of the Nabû temple were laid above the remains of several earlier temples. Later, when the scribes realized their mistake, references to the temple’s history were no longer included in reports of this accomplishment of Sîn-šarra-iškun; compare text nos. 11–12. For further details, see Novotny, Kaskal 11 (2014) pp. 162–165. Ex. 1 was inscribed in the eponymy of Bēl-aḫu-uṣur, the palace overseer (616*).

The king claims that the work was carried out according to the craft of the incantation-priest, that (some of) the foundations were relaid, that he built (part of) the superstructure (presumably from the foundations to the crenellations), did something with its “grand designs,” and returned the temple’s divine owners Nabû and Tašmētu to their daises. The work, if the inscription is to be believed, started in his accession year (627 BC); however, it is very likely that this is just royal rhetoric. The dated cylinders were inscribed in the eponymy of Daddî, the treasurer (622*). In scholarly literature, this text is generally referred to as “Cylinder B.”     Access the  composite text  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap5/Q003880/]  of Sîn-šarra-iškun 19.

      "text": "This planned four-year (2015–19) open-access sub-project of the  Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/index.html]  intends to present up-to-date editions of all of the known Akkadian and Sumerian royal inscriptions of the rulers of Assyria’s last great king, Ashurbanipal (668–ca. 631 BC), and his lesser known successors Aššur-etel-ilāni (ca. 631–627/626 BC), Sîn-šumu-līšir (627/626 BC), Sîn-šarra-iškun (627/626–612 BC), and Aššur-uballiṭ II (611–609 BC). Unlike the other RINAP sub-projects, the RINAP 5 sub-project is a collaborative effort between the  NEH  [http://www.neh.gov] -funded RINAP Project (under the direction of Grant Frame) and the  Humboldt  [https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html] -funded  Munich Open-access Cuneiform Corpus Initiative (MOCCI)  [http://www.en.ag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/research/mocci/index.html]  (headed by Karen Radner and Jamie Novotny) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. The primary authors of  The Royal Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (668-631 BC), Aššur-etel-ilāni (630-627 BC) and Sîn-šarra-iškun (626-612 BC), Kings of Assyria, Part 1  are Jamie Novotny (LMU Munich) and Joshua Jeffers (University of Pennsylvania). In addition, Grant Frame will be a co-author of Part 2 since that volume will include (updated) material from his  Rulers of Babylonia: From the Second Dynasty of Isin to the End of Assyrian Domination (1157-612 BC)  (The Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia, Babylonian Periods 2; hereafter RIMB 2).    Material will be posted online as soon as it is deemed suitable. However, it should be stressed here that some of the contents of the web pages, including the editions (together with their notes), will regularly change, and without warning. As of May 2018, this applies only to the contents of  The Royal Inscriptions of Ashurbanipal (668–631 BC), Aššur-etel-ilāni (630–627 BC) and Sîn-šarra-iškun (626–612 BC), Kings of Assyria, Part 2 , which will include Ashurbanipal texts 72-2018, Aššur-etel-ilāni texts 1-6, and Sîn-šarra-iškun 1-21.  Therefore, we urge caution should you cite the content of RINAP 5/2. On the other hand, the contents of RINAP 5/1 (Ashurbanipal texts 1-71), will not change, as the final, camera-ready manuscript of RINAP 5/1 has been sent to the publisher (Eisenbrauns). Please feel free to cite the content of that book.    Scores of the composite texts included on this site can be found on the RINAP  Scores  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/scores/index.html]  sub-project. Transliterations of the witnesses are available on the RINAP  Sources  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/sources/index.html]  sub-project.      Sponsors and timing        This website was created as part of the  Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period (RINAP) Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/index.html]  and the   Official Inscriptions of the Middle East in Antiquity (OIMEA) Project  [http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/oimea/index.html]  (a sub-project of MOCCI). Funding is provided by the  National Endowment for the Humanities  [http://www.neh.gov]  (NEH) and by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (through the establishment of the  Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Ancient History of the Near and Middle East  [http://www.ag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/lehrstuehle/ls_radner/index.html] ) and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Historisches Seminar - Abteilung Alte Geschichte). Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed on this website do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities or the Humboldt Foundation. The project began in May 2015 and Phase 1 of the website was made available in fall 2016. Additional content (in front material, introduction, and back material of RINAP 5/1) was added in May and June 2018.     Since the RINAP 5 sub-project is intended to be a four-year year (ending in 2019) and since there is much work to do and finish before we have reached our primary objects, please be patient with us as we expand, improve, and refine our content.
